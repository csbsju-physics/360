    <p>Iran has reportedly acknowledged receiving a letter from the U.S. about the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has threatened to close off that waterway, a main route for oil tankers, if sanctions are imposed against the country's oil sales. An Iranian news agency says the letter is being studied and the government is determining whether to respond.</p>
