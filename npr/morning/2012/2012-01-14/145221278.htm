    <p>SIMON: Our What's In a Song segment, about a group sing-along at the home of a Utah folklorist who survived a stroke, brought recollections from many listeners, including Dayle Stratton, who writes: It took me back home to the Western mountains I love so much. I haven't suffered a stroke, but have an illness that affects my memory at times, and limits my life in other ways sporadically. I find singing restores me to a full sense of myself. Thank you for a beautiful story about some good people and the best kind of music - that which we sing ourselves.</p>
