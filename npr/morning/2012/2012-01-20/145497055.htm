    <p>TANYA OTT, BYLINE: I'm standing near the main commercial road through a middle-class Birmingham suburb, and in a mile-and-a-half stretch there are 11 payday loan operations.</p>
    <p>The number of payday lenders has skyrocketed in the last two decades. Twenty million American households use them, sometimes paying what amounts to 500 percent interest.</p>
    <p>At the bureau's first hearings yesterday in Birmingham, resident Quinn Callins says a loan ruined his sister's life.</p>
    <p>QUINN CALLINS: A payday loan of $500 ended up costing my sister a $15,000 car plus $5,000 that she paid on the loans.</p>
    <p>OTT: Callins says his sister was so ashamed; she cut all ties with the family.</p>
    <p>Richard Cordray says consumer want and need short-term loans, but his agency knows some operators are breaking the law.</p>
    <p>RICHARD CORDRAY: Harassing families, friends, co-workers in ways that are prohibited by federal law.</p>
    <p>OTT: One payday lending CEO who testified said his customers are intelligent and the fees he charges are in line with the risk he takes.</p>
