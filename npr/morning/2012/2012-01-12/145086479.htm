<h1> "Thieves Find Big Money In Stolen Plastic" </h1>

    <p>And today's last word in business is plastics.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "THE GRADUATE")</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That's a character in the movie "The Graduate," offering career advice to a young Dustin Hoffman.</p>
    <p>Some people in L.A. allegedly took that advice. Four men were arrested there this week with a quarter-of-a- million dollars worth of stolen plastic pallets - milk crates and bread baskets piled high in a warehouse. That same warehouse held a big, industrial plastic grinder.</p>
    <p>Now I'm thinking of the movie "Fargo." Never mind.</p>
    <p>The L.A. County Sheriff's Office says there's big money in stolen plastic. It sells for up to a dollar a pound. And most of that stolen plastic is sold back to the manufacturers it was stolen from in the first place.</p>
    <p>That's the business news on MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
