    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene.</p>
    <p>A pub in Newcastle, England is taking its pet-friendly policy to new levels. They're serving dogs beer. You know, to make sure pets aren't left out when their owners are enjoying a pint. The bottles are labeled dog beer, and the Daily Mail shows a photo of a dog lapping up the beer from a glass. The special brew is made of malt, hops and meat extract and it is non-alcoholic. The bar manager's dog, Franco the beagle, is not a fan.</p>
