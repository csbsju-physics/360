<h1> "U.N. Security Council Meets On Syria Solutions" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>The situation in Syria growing even more violent. Activists inside the country say at least 60 people died yesterday, some in what appeared to be a sectarian attack. The United Nations Security Council is set to meet again today to discuss its response to Syria.</p>
    <p>And we have more this morning from NPR's Kelly McEvers in Beirut.</p>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: One of the most shocking attacks was in the central Syrian city of Homs, where fierce anti-government protests have given way to clashes between pro- and anti-government forces. A family of 14, including eight children, was found dead in their home. A video provided by activists shows the children were shot in the head.</p>
    <p>Activists say the killers were pro-government thugs. These are usually from the minority Alawite sect. The United Nations estimates some 6,000 people have died since the anti-government uprising began in March. The UN Security Council will meet to consider a new draft resolution on Syria later today.</p>
    <p>Russia has so far has threatened to veto a resolution on Syria. But Arab and Western officials say they've written the new draft in a way that might be acceptable to Russia. That resolution would blame the Syrian regime for the current crisis and call for a negotiated process for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abdicate power.</p>
