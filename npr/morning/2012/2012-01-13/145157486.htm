<h1> "N.Y. Philharmonic Interrupted By Ringing Cellphone" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene.</p>
    <p>We've all heard the rule: Turn off your cell phone. Well, someone broke it this week at a performance of the New York Philharmonic.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CELL PHONE RINGING)</p>
    <p>GREENE: The iPhone Marimba ring tone had not been written into Mahler's Ninth Symphony. But there it was, chirping from the front row of the audience. The conductor was so incensed, he cut off the performance and waited for the iPhone to stop. The audience member was apparently not offered an audition.</p>
