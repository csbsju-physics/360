<h1> "Murdoch Tweets About Myspace Failure" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>And today's last word in business is an announcement made in the middle of the night. It came from Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corps.</p>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>The owner of many newspapers and Fox News recently started sending out messages on Twitter, and overnight he commented on one of News Corps' failures: its expensive purchase of MySpace, a social networking site that swiftly passed out of fashion.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Early this morning on Twitter, Murdoch confessed, quote, "many questions and jokes about MySpace. Simple answer: We screwed up in every way possible, learned lots of valuable, expensive lessons."</p>
    <p>GREENE: Now we don't know what time zone Murdoch was in when he made that confession, but the tweet came across at 2:05 AM Eastern Time.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And Murdoch's message prompted a variety of responses, some critical and others sympathetic. Maria-Helena Miranda tweeted back: Sir, don't feel bad. It's all about life's learning journey.</p>
    <p>And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION, from NPR News.</p>
    <p>GREENE: I'm David Greene.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
