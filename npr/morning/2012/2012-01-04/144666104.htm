<h1> "Stolen E.T. Statue Returned To Owner" </h1>
    <p>LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Linda Wertheimer. A British woman had a break-in in September. Thieves stole a life-size statue of E.T., the extraterrestrial from the famous film. She thought it was gone for good until last week, when a passerby saw it floating in a river and called the police. They reunited the statue with its owner. So, a little late for the holidays, a little soggy, E.T. finally did phone home. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
