<h1> "Iconic Witch Shop To Close In Salem, Mass." </h1>

    <p>And today's last word in business is: The spell is broken.</p>
    <p>The town of Salem, Massachusetts, is known for its violent history of the Salem witch trials of the 17th century. But more than 40 years ago, an advocate and teacher of witchcraft helped to make it a tourist destination.</p>
    <p>Laurie Cabot opened the town's first witch shop in 1970. A few years later, she was named the official witch of Salem by then Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Cabot's store was reborn under several names and locations over the years, but she has announced on her website that today will be the last day of business for the final incarnation of her brick-and-mortar witch store. Her online store will still be around, offering broomsticks, cauldrons, chalices and more.</p>
