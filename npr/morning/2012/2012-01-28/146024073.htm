<h1> "Your Letters: On Propaganda And Appreciation" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p>
    <p>Time now for your letters. Last week we spoke with Christian Bale who stars in the new film, "The Flowers of War." The movie takes place in China during Japan's violent occupation of Nanjing in 1937. "The Flowers of War" has been criticized as being part of an effort by the Chinese government to improve China's image in the world.</p>
    <p>Roy Merritt posted at NPR.org: I think we should take Mr. Bale's word on whether the movie is a propaganda piece. The story revolves around a true incident and that can not be disputed. Most people are astute enough to know when they're being preached at and or manipulated, and will think accordingly.</p>

    <p>SIMON: Gwen Thompkins' personal appreciation of Etta James moved many listeners to tears, laughter and reflection.</p>
    <p>LuAnn Jones of Richmond, Virginia, writes: The songs you chose to illustrate Etta's unique talent tapped into exactly what made her so wonderful. Something positively primal about her strong and sultry voice spoke to us in that deep dark place that only a well-placed moan can reach.</p>
