<h1> "Letters To Tucson, One Year After The Shooting" </h1>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE OF PEOPLE SAYING "DEAR TUCSON")</p>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>It's been a year since a gunman opened fire at a Tucson grocery store. Six people were killed and 13 injured, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords. NPR's State of the Re:Union asked people who were present that day at the shooting to write letters to Tucson, reflecting on their city and the year since the tragedy.</p>
    <p>RON BARBER: Unlike most places, Tucson is green in the dead of winter.</p>
    <p>SUZI HILEMAN: The bright, beautiful crisp Saturday morning that was January 8, 2011.</p>
    <p>ROSS ZIMMERMAN: Shots broke the morning calm.</p>
    <p>PATRICIA MAISCH: I was shot while holding my 9-year-old friend's hand. She's dead and I am here. Christina Taylor and I were waiting to shake our congresswoman's hand. We went from thrilled to damaged in an instant.</p>
    <p>ZIMMERMAN: We lost dear friends, a talented child, a caring judge and my beloved colleague.</p>
    <p>BARBER: Tucson has become a much lonelier place for me.</p>
    <p>PAMELA SIMON: When I pull into my garage, I faced a large cardboard sign. It says Tucson, then a red heart and then the scrolled word Pam. Tucson loves Pam.</p>
    <p>MAISCH: I had thought that I would be anonymous. I was not. I was noticed, marveled at. I was hugged and prayed over and smiled at and my hand was shaken, my shoulder touched, my knee patted. And it's still going on today.</p>
    <p>SIMON: In the year that followed, I, like you, have lived under a cloud of grief.</p>
    <p>ZIMMERMAN: I love and will always remember Gabe but he'll never return. I love this place but that's not sufficient. A shadow lies across my home.</p>
    <p>HILEMAN: Remember them. Keep them close.</p>
    <p>SIMON: In the most difficult moments, you sent me a sunset, the smell of the desert after a rainstorm, mariachi music and the peace of a Sabino Canyon walk. Tucson, you wrap me in your arms during an inconceivable time.</p>
    <p>MAISCH: I love you, Tucson, just as much as you love me.</p>
