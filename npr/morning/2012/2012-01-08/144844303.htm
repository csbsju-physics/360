<h1> "Arrange The Notes" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. And it's time for the puzzle.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Let's start with last week's challenge from the puzzle editor of the New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzle master, Will Shortz.</p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ, BYLINE: Name certain scores in a certain sport - and this is a two-word phrase with a total of 10 letters; five letters in each word. If you have the right phrase, you can rearrange all the letters to name a different sport, also in two words - six letters in the first word, four in the second. What are the scores and what is the sport?</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK. So, almost 240 of you figured out the answer. And our randomly selected winner this week is David Meacham. He's from Parkville, Missouri. Congratulations, David.</p>
    <p>DAVID MEACHAM: Thank you.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: So, David, tell us what's the answer to last week's challenge?</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Well, the answer I came up with was field goals and ladies golf.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK. So, how did you come to the answer? How did you figure it out?</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Well, field goals came to me pretty quickly, and then I had to think about it for a while. And when I was in church actually, I just did the pyramid of words, as I learned from Will, and then I came up with ladies golf.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Church? David, I hope the minister didn't take it personally that you were doing the puzzle.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Oh, they both know about it, so I hope they'll be listening.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And, David, what do you do in Parkville, Missouri?</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Well, I actually work in Kansas City, Missouri. Parkville is just outside. I work at a hotel downtown and I am the general cashier.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK. So, just between you and me, do you ever do a puzzle on the job?</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Occasionally, yes.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Ooh, I knew it. Before we continue, though, let's welcome puzzle master Will Shortz to the program. Good morning, Will.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Hi, Rachel. First of all, welcome to the show.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Thank you so much.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: And, David, congratulations.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Thank you.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: So, David, now's your big chance. Is there a question brewing that you've always wanted to ask Will?</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Well, I did see the movie "Wordplay" and I remember the part Will was getting the rather angry letters from people regarding the puzzle. And I was just wondering what possibly is the strangest thing you've received in the mail?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Strangest thing - there's a lady on Long Island whose mother had just died, and her mother was a big doer of the New York Times crossword. The funeral was going to be in two days, and the lady asked me to send her a copy of next Sunday's New York Times magazine, which could be put in the casket with her mother.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Wow.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: So, we FedExed a copy of the next Sunday's magazine, and now her mother is happy in eternity.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: She's - yeah, talk about being a part of someone's life. That's kind of a profound piece of mail. OK. David, so now is the time. Are you ready to play the puzzle?</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: I'm as ready as I'm going to be.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: All right. Will, let's go for it.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right, David and Rachel. Today's puzzle is called Arrangement of Notes. Each answer is a five-letter word of phrase containing the letters N-O-T and E, plus one other letter, and you answer the clues to get the words. For example, if I said N-O-T-E plus A to make a word meaning to make amends, you would say atone.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Got it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: OK. And the added letter can go in any position in the answer. Here's your first one: note N-O-T-E plus B, as in boy. And your clue is a kind of steak S-T-E-A-K.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: T-Bone.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: T-Bone. That was a fast one.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Oh fun.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Number two is note plus C, and it's the French word for story.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: French word for story.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: French. I'm trying to channel my high school French.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: I took Spanish in school but never French.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Oh, it's probably a related word. I don't know Spanish for story. Do you know this one, Rachel?</p>
    <p>MARTIN: You know, I was thinking I did, but it doesn't include the letters N-O-T-E-C, so I guess I don't.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: OK. Well, the answer is conte C-O-N-T-E. That's the French word for a story or a tale. All right.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK. Now we know, now we know.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: I'll always remember that.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Now you know. This show is so educational. Your next one is note plus D, and your clue is in good physical shape.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Toned.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Toned. That's fast. Note plus G, to make mount, and it's a two-word phrase.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Get on.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's fast.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Ooh nice.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Plus I, to mean attach to, and, again, it's a two-word phrase.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Tie on.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Tie on is it. Plus L, to mean add a slow tempo in music.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Lento.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Um-hum. Plus M, as in Mary, to make a French impressionist.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Monet.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Um-hum. Plus P, as in Peter, to make bridge. You want the Italian word for bridge.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Is it ponte?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. Plus R, to get contents of a certain cartridge.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Contents of a certain cartridge.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Toner.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Toner is it. Plus S to make beginning.</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Plus S - onset.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's fast. And you're last one, plus T - and this is a fill in the blank clue - Grand blank National Park</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: Teton.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Yay.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That was so good, David.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: David...</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: I brought my new French.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Oh, I know. You and me, both.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: But you made it easy for me. I could kind of sit back and have a cup of coffee while you took that one.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MEACHAM: That was a lot of fun.</p>
