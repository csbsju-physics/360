<h1> "This Puzzle Is The Pits" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. Time now for the puzzle.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And joining us now is the puzzle editor of the New York Times, and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzle master, Will Shortz. Good morning, Will.</p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK. So today, we are finally unveiling the results of our special, two-week, creative challenge. This was a big one. But before we get to that, I know we have a couple of corrections to make to last week's puzzle.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. In last week's puzzle, I asked what is the only planet that comes alphabetically between Mars and Saturn? I gave the answer Mercury. But as several listeners pointed out, Neptune also fits between them.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK. And also, our East Coast listeners may have heard us mistakenly call Calgary, Canada, a capital city - I think I did that. The Canadian government did recently name Calgary a cultural capital but technically, Calgary is not a capital city. So apologies to all my Canadian friends, and thank you to all of our very attentive listeners who helped us catch those mistakes.</p>
    <p>Now, back to the business at hand: this week's puzzle. Will, you challenged us to come up with amusing sentences using just TV show titles. And we received more than 580 entries. And I understand that you read all of them. What were some of your favorites?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: The first one is from Bill Trotter of Ellsworth, Maine: Desperate housewives in search of good times kidnapped the bachelor.</p>
    <p>One of the longest, that was also nice, came from Tim Erskine of Columbus, Ohio: I've got a secret, wise guy. Once upon a time, all my children - Ed, Ellen, Felicity, Maude, Gidget, Tom and Jerry, the magnificent seven - chopped family ties. This is your life. Work out family matters, step by step, one day at a time.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Wow.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: And one more - came from Patrick Berry of Jasper, Alabama. He wrote: Father knows best who's the boss. That's my mama.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And I know, Will, you've saved the best for last. Tell us who's the winner this week.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: The winner is - again, Patrick Berry, who sent one of the runners-up. His winning entry is: The nanny lost all my children.</p>
    <p>And I chose that for its simplicity and naturalness; it made me laugh. And when I read the top entries to friends, everyone selected this as their favorite.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Well, Patrick is joining us on the line right now. Congratulations, Patrick.</p>
    <p>PATRICK BERRY: Thank you very much, Rachel.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And say hello to Will Shortz.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Hello, Will. It is an honor and a pleasure to meet you.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Hey, Patrick. And you know, you share a name with one of the best and most prolific crossword constructors in the country: Patrick Berry from Athens, Georgia.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And Patrick, you - yourself - you don't just do crossword puzzles; you actually write them?</p>
    <p>BERRY: I'm into cryptic crosswords, the British style.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Cryptic crosswords - I don't even know what that is. Will, do you know what that is?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yeah, those are my favorite crosswords, too.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Really?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: We'll go into detail on that someday.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Oh, good. OK. You two have a special bond there. OK.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Well, this should be an interesting puzzle, with two expert puzzlers. Let's go for it, Will. What is this week's puzzle?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right. Patrick and Rachel, today's puzzle is: the pits. Every answer is a familiar two-word phrase or name, in which the first word starts with P-I and the second word starts with T. For example, if I said an old route taken by covered wagons, you would say pioneer trail.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Number one: an eating surface at a park.</p>
    <p>BERRY: An eating surface - picnic table.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Picnic table is it. Number two: Cones grow on it.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Pine tree.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Nice.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Nice.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Pepperoni, sausage or mushrooms.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Pizza topping.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: A classic English poem of circa 1536, written in the style of Chaucer. And the title starts with "the."</p>
    <p>BERRY: Take a risk tale - or something.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Tale is correct. And for the first word, it's a possessive, and it would name the early settlers in Massachusetts.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Oh, "A Pilgrim's Tale."</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: "The Pilgrim's Tale" is it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: There.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: A mouth feature of many a punk rocker.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Pierced tongue.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Pierced tongue is good.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Wow. Well done, Patrick.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: How about a former Canadian prime minister.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Pierre Trudeau.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. And your last one...</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Thank goodness you got that. Otherwise, we were going to insult our Canadian friends again.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: And your last one: a chest of stolen gold, silver, precious gems, etc.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Pirate treasure.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Oh, well done, Patrick. You had virtually no hesitations. You nailed all those. Congratulations.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Yeah. Thank you very much.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And for playing our puzzle today, you'll get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin as well as puzzle books and games. You can read all about it at NPR.org/Puzzle. And Patrick, which public radio station do you listen to?</p>
    <p>BERRY: That would be 90.3, WBHM, in Birmingham.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Nice. Shoutout to Birmingham. Patrick Berry, thanks so much for playing the Puzzle this week.</p>
    <p>BERRY: Thank you very much.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK, Will. What do you have to stump us with for next week?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes, this week's challenge comes from listener Ed Pegg Jr., who runs the website MathPuzzle.com. And it is a math puzzle. Write the digits from 1 to 9 in a line. If you put a plus sign after the 2, a times sign after the 4, and plus signs after the 6 and 8, the line shows 12 + 34 x 56 + 78 + 9, which equals 2003. And that's nine years off from our current year, 2012. Now, this example uses four arithmetic symbols. [POST-BROADCAST CLARIFICATION: The sum does not equal 2003 when arithmetic operations are performed in order from left to right. However, the challenge that follows â to use arithmetic signs in three places in a line from 1 to 9, to equal 2012 when operations are performed in order â can be solved.]</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: The object is to use just three arithmetic signs - plus, minus, times and division; using just any of those signs - in a line from 1 to 9 to get 2012 exactly. The operation should be performed in order from left to right. There's no trick to this puzzle. Can you do it?</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Will, you're killing me. It's a math problem.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: When you have the answer go to our website, NPR.org/puzzle, click on the Submit Your Answer link. Just one entry per person, please, and our deadline for entries is Thursday, February 2nd at 3 PM Eastern Time. Please include a phone number where we can reach you at about that time.

    <p>Will, thanks so much.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Thanks, Rachel.</p>
