<h1> "Dropout Has Thanks, Not Blame, For Teacher" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Now for another conversation from StoryCorps' National Teacher Initiative.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: This school year, we'll be sharing stories from and about teachers and their students. Today's story started at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, which has an official graduation rate of just 48 percent. Roger Alvarez was one of the students who didn't make it through his senior year. He dropped out in 2007. At StoryCorps, Roger sat down with his former English teacher, Antero Garcia. It was the first time they had seen each other since Roger quit school.</p>
    <p>ANTERO GARCIA: When did you know you weren't going to graduate, like, for sure?</p>
    <p>ROGER ALVAREZ: For sure?</p>
    <p>GARCIA: Yeah.</p>
    <p>ALVAREZ: Ever since I started in 9th grade.</p>
    <p>GARCIA: Oh, really?</p>
    <p>ALVAREZ: There's a certain amount of knowledge you have to have when you enter in a specific grade, and I didn't have it. Every class I took, I'd be, like, do I know this? I don't know this. I'm not going to pass the class. And it was kind of shameful, you know. I don't know, I thought...</p>
    <p>GARCIA: What was shameful?</p>
    <p>ALVAREZ: You know, like you were determined to help me but what I was willing to give? I could have actually tried.</p>
    <p>GARCIA: I guess I'm curious how could I have reached out to you better?</p>
    <p>ALVAREZ: Well, you always helped me, but, I mean, you could pump me up and then I see others doing way better. So, then I get nervous. I get stuck. And then my motivation goes to the floor.</p>
    <p>GARCIA: Did it feel hopeless?</p>
    <p>ALVAREZ: Yeah. You talked to me like if I could do it. But inside me, I know I couldn't. And, you know, I just don't want you to think that I'm, like, stupid.</p>
    <p>GARCIA: Well, why did you agree to come and talk to me today?</p>
    <p>ALVAREZ: I don't know. It's, I mean, I see school as a tool in life and all this time I've been missing that tool. It's not part of my belt. But I wanted, like, to explain myself to you now that I'm older. You know, always I just want you to know, I always want to let you know that you were a good teacher and I always respected you. Some teachers I kind of felt like they only wanted to teach a certain group of people. But you looked at me and you paid attention. Maybe it didn't get me to graduate but there's a lot of teachers, they don't take the time to take a look. And it was never your fault.</p>
