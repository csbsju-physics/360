<h1> "Stolen Car Lands Perfectly On Calif. House Roof" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. It's hard to believe a driver could deliberately do what a man in Fresno, California did by mistake. Police say the man stole a car. Soon after, a woman in a nearby house felt what seemed like an earthquake. She had to go outside to see the truth. The car thief drove too fast, lost control on a curve, shot up a slope, launched over landscaping rocks and landed the car on the sloping roof of the house, just as perfectly as if he had parked there. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
