<h1> "Shark That Reproduced Sexually Switches To Asexually, Report Says" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene with the story of a shark named Leonie. She's a proud mom - gave birth last year to three baby sharks. Here's the thing. She hadn't had any contact with a male shark.</p>
    <p>Now, the British magazine New Scientist reports some animals that reproduce sexually can occasionally reproduce asexually. And that does include sharks. But usually it happens when a female has never had male contact. Leonie had a ton of offspring with a male partner, then apparently decided she would just do it her way. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
