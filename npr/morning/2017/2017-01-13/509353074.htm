<h1> "Scientists Have Twisted Molecules Into The Tightest Knot Ever" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Diplomacy can be its own kind of tricky knot. But tying a literal knot can be really difficult - just ask any kid who's struggling with shoelaces. Now imagine how much harder it would be to make a knot in a molecule. That's what some scientists have been trying to do. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on the tightest knot ever tied.</p>
    <p>NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Knots may not seem high-tech. But once our prehistoric ancestors figured out knots, it led to all kinds of innovation.</p>
    <p>DAVID LEIGH: Like fishing nets and axes with blades tied to the handles.</p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: David Leigh is a chemist at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. And he says knots could be just as revolutionary at the molecular level.</p>
    <p>LEIGH: But we can't exploit that until we learn how to make them.</p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: The first molecular knot made by a chemist had three loops. It looked a bit like a three-leaf clover. Leigh says that's the simplest kind of knot possible.</p>
    <p>LEIGH: And then, for the next 25 years, chemists weren't able to make any more complicated knots than that.</p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: Which is surprising considering that mathematicians have come up with billions of possible knots. Well, just in the last few years, scientists have managed to produce a couple of more complex knots. And now, in the journal Science, Leigh and his colleagues have unveiled the most intricate one yet. It looks a lot like a Celtic knot, and making this out of molecules wasn't easy.</p>
    <p>LEIGH: You can't tie the knots by grabbing the ends and mechanically tying them like you would a shoelace in our everyday world. Instead, you have to use chemistry.</p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: Leigh's team designed strands of atoms that could effectively braid themselves together in a test tube.</p>
    <p>LEIGH: And being able to braid, like you braid a girl's hair in elementary school, allows you to make much, much more complicated knots and ultimately opens the door for weaving as well, which will be very exciting.</p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because molecular weaving could produce materials with interesting new properties.</p>
    <p>Edward Fenlon is a chemist at Franklin & Marshall College who has a special interest in knots. He says this new one is fantastic.</p>
    <p>EDWARD FENLON: It's really impressive that they've been able to go beyond some of the more simple knots with just three crossings.</p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says this knot has eight crossings, and that makes it the tightest knot ever. Here's how he assesses tightness.</p>
    <p>FENLON: So it's just the length of the rope and then how complex the knot is, how many crossings you have.</p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: In this case, the rope, if you will, is very short - just 192 atoms long, 500 times smaller than a red blood cell.</p>
