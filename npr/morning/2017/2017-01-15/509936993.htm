<h1> "Shut The Front Door!" </h1>
    <p>LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>Do you judge people who swear?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE GOOD PLACE")</p>
    <p>KRISTEN BELL: (As Eleanor) Somebody royally forked up.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: In her latest show, "The Good Place," actress Kristen Bell wants to curse but can't. You see, she's in heaven, and swearing's not allowed.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE GOOD PLACE")</p>
    <p>BELL: (As Eleanor) Why can't I say fork?</p>
    <p>WILLIAM JACKSON HARPER: (As Chidi) If you're trying to curse, you can't here.</p>
    <p>BELL: (As Eleanor) That's bull-shirt.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: But a recent study suggests, maybe we should think better of bad language. It was published in the journal - and this is a real mouthful - Social Psychological and Personality Science. And it found, I'll quote them here, "a consistent positive relationship between profanity and honesty."</p>
    <p>So basically, if you swear, you're likely telling the truth. FYI, I swear a lot - in private, though. We at NPR would face steep fines if we actually cursed on-air. So we asked around for alternative swear words. What do you say in polite company or around kids? When Jordan Weiner of Pennsylvania gets mad...</p>
    <p>JORDAN WEINER: Embarrassingly enough, I say slug in the ditch.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Slug in a ditch?</p>
    <p>WEINER: Yup. Like the slug, the yucky garden thing - yup.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Weiner says it's a good substitute for son-of-something when he's around his young daughter.</p>
    <p>For Nancy Strand of Arizona, her swearing years have come and gone.</p>
    <p>NANCY STRAND: I'm too old to like the F-bomb. I don't like that one at all.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Luckily, she's got her dad's old saying.</p>
    <p>STRAND: Dirty pup.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's dirty pup.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CEELO GREEN SONG, "FORGET YOU")</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: We got this one from Sarah Ricard in Little Rock.</p>
    <p>SARAH RICARD: Flap-doodle.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Flap-doodle.</p>
    <p>RICARD: It sounds really silly, but it makes me feel better.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Dave Honnecker of North Carolina has the Coen brothers to thank for his go-to G-rated curse.</p>
    <p>DAVE HONNECKER: If I'm really, really mad, I'll be (imitating anger) mother-scratcher. But if it's something that's just a minor annoyance, it's more like - oh, mother-scratcher.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: And whether you've just stubbed your toe or you're giving some mother-scratcher a piece of your mind, Jordan Weiner thinks that study may have some truth to it.</p>
    <p>WEINER: It makes complete sense to me. Being someone that's more honest - yeah, you're going to say whatever's on your mind, whether it's clean or not.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, then, fudge this - I'm just going to say it - (expletive).</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "FORGET YOU")</p>
    <p>CEELO GREEN: (Singing) See you driving 'round town with the girl I love, and I'm like forget you. Oh, oh, oh. I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough. I'm like forget you, and forget her, too.</p>
