<h1> "Orlando Is On Edge As Search Continues For Suspect In Police Killing " </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>There's a manhunt underway in Orlando. Police there are looking for a person who shot and killed one of their own. Her name is Master Sergeant Debra Clayton. Her department is remembering her and another officer who died in a car crash connected to the incident. From member station WMFE, Abe Aboraya reports.</p>
    <p>ABE ABORAYA, BYLINE: Larry Parzygnat, an officer with the Welaka Police Department, drove nearly two hours to a makeshift memorial at a Wal-Mart in Orlando. He laid a police badge near a white cross.</p>
    <p>LARRY PARZYGNAT: It's a very dangerous job, and any moment, it could be over. You just don't know.</p>
    <p>ABORAYA: What we do know, it started early Monday at this Wal-Mart. Markeith Loyd has been wanted by police since December for the alleged murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Someone recognized Loyd at the Wal-Mart and told the nearest police officer. That was Master Sergeant Deborah Clayton. She radioed for backup and approach Loyd. Police say they exchanged gunfire, and Clayton died.</p>
    <p>During the manhunt, Deputy Norman Lewis with the Orange County Sheriff's Office was killed during a traffic accident. He was an ex-University of Central Florida football player and described as a gentle giant.</p>
    <p>The reward to find Loyd is up to $100,000. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings says there have been more than 500 tips.</p>

    <p>JERRY DEMINGS: In fact, there were times when we just missed him. But he has been able to avoid capture. He's not going to be able to do that for much longer.</p>
    <p>ABORAYA: Funerals for the officers are planned for tomorrow and Saturday. Emotions have been raw, including at this vigil for Clayton recorded and posted on the Orlando Police Department's Twitter feed.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine.</p>
    <p>ABORAYA: Clayton was known for volunteering and mentoring to prevent youth violence. Her adult son, Johnny, spoke at the vigil, saying everything his mom worked for, she died for.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>JOHNNY CLAYTON: We've just got to keep pushing forward. We can make it a better city.</p>
    <p>ABORAYA: To do that, law enforcement say they need to find the person who led to the deaths of two of their own this week.</p>
