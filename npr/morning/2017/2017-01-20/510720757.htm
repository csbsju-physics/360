<h1> "Spilled Skittles Turn Wisconsin Road Red" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin with a story about what could be in your hamburger. It starts in Wisconsin, where a whole bunch of red Skittles were found on a road. Officials figured out that the candies fell out of a truck that was taking them to be used in cattle feed. One farmer said it's a good way to give cows, quote, "cheap carbs." The sheriff's department posted the story on its Facebook page. One commenter called it absolutely gross. Another said - hey, strawberry Skittles equals strawberry milk, right? It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
