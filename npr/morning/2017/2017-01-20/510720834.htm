<h1> "Investigative Reporter Wayne Barrett Dies At 71" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>This morning we are mourning the loss of one man who chronicled Donald Trump's rise. Wayne Barrett died yesterday at the age of 71.</p>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Barrett made a name for himself as an investigative reporter at The Village Voice newspaper. He was a dogged critic of New York mayors Ed Koch - Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani and a certain Donald J. Trump.</p>

    <p>WAYNE BARRETT: I've always felt I could go toe-to-toe with anybody.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: That's Barrett speaking to New York local news in 2011.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Now, in 1992, Barrett wrote "Trump: The Deals And The Downfall." The book was a flop at first, but Barrett's deep knowledge of the president-elect made him a go-to source for journalists during the 2016 campaign.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: He suffered from lung disease, but Barrett continued his reporting on Donald Trump through Election Day. He told Democracy Now! last year that Trump motivated him.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>BARRETT: You know I'm in a sick bed a lot, but he gets me up out of it.</p>
    <p>GREENE: That is journalist Wayne Barrett who died yesterday at 71 years old.</p>
