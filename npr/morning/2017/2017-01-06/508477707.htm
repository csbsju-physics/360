<h1> "Despite Controversy, A College Band From Alabama Will March In Trump's Parade" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>There is a lot of talk about who is and who isn't taking part in the presidential inauguration festivities this month. A band from Alabama's oldest private historically black college is expected to march in the parade, but some alumni of Talladega College are not happy about that decision. In fact, there have been days of protests over it. Sherrel Wheeler Stewart of member station WBHM reports.</p>
    <p>SHERREL WHEELER STEWART, BYLINE: Talladega College isn't known for its football team because it doesn't have one, but it does have a band - the Marching Tornadoes - the pride of the campus in this town about 50 miles east of Birmingham.</p>

    <p>STEWART: Participation in this inauguration is not popular for some Talladega alims like Shirley Ferrill, a 1974 graduate. She says what Donald Trump said on the campaign trail is not consistent with the values of Talladega College. Other groups like the Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have had similar concerns about performing in the inauguration.</p>
    <p>SHIRLEY FERRILL: To have them take part in anything that smacks of support for Donald Trump makes me sick.</p>
    <p>STEWART: For Ferrill, this issue points back to the school's history, a school founded by former slaves in 1867 and a college which has supported the black community ever since.</p>
    <p>FERRILL: I do care what others think about the college's participation. I care about the reputation Talladega has established over 150 years, and I think that reputation would be damaged by the college participating.</p>
    <p>STEWART: Ferrill launched an online petition calling for Talladega to decline the invitation. More than 1,600 people have signed it, but the decision to go is welcomed by others.</p>
    <p>TIFFANY HARRELL: Y'all are going?</p>
    <p>DARRIOUS HAYES: We are going.</p>
    <p>HARRELL: Hot diggity (ph) damn.</p>
    <p>STEWART: That's Tiffany Harrell, a store clerk, chatting with band member Darrious Hayes, who's returning to campus this week after winter break. Hayes has been in the band since 2014, his freshman year. He says the trip to the inauguration is an opportunity.</p>
    <p>HAYES: I have never been to D.C. Like, the alumni don't want us to go because of Trump, but we saying it's not because of Donald Trump, it's 'cause of the experience.</p>
    <p>STEWART: On campus yesterday, it was quiet. College officials limited access, and a campus police officer even approached me.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED CAMPUS POLICE OFFICER: Not allowing any of the reporters on the campus to talk to the students.</p>
    <p>STEWART: No college administrators would answer questions about the decision. A Talladega spokeswoman did say it's a good opportunity for students. The Talladega Marching Tornadoes played at an NFL game in New Orleans last year, but this performance at the presidential inauguration will be its biggest ever.
