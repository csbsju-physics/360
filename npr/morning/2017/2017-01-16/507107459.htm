<h1> "Do Anti-Snoring Gadgets Really Work?" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>All right, so, Rachel, I don't call my wife by the wrong name. But she tells me that occasionally, I do do this.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SNORING)</p>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>(Laughter).</p>
    <p>GREENE: Although, it doesn't sound that bad. So you can actually create health problems for your partner if you're snoring, and it's a serious thing.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Yes.</p>
    <p>GREENE: But there are some gadgets that can help. And here's NPR's Patti Neighmond.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK.</p>
    <p>PATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: Here I am standing in my local pharmacy, looking at a row of anti-snoring aids - nasal strips, Breathe Right, snore therapy. I wonder if any of these work.</p>
    <p>KIM HUTCHISON: Talking about what may or may not work, we would first identify where the sound comes from.</p>
    <p>NEIGHMOND: Dr. Kim Hutchison is a sleep specialist at Oregon Health and Science University. Before she recommends gadgets, she says there's one important caveat.</p>
    <p>HUTCHISON: I don't want to fix their snoring without alerting them to the fact that this may be a symptom of something more serious.</p>
    <p>NEIGHMOND: Like sleep apnea, where patients actually stop breathing, sometimes hundreds of times a night. Once that's ruled out, snoring is basically a mechanical problem. And for that, there's an array of what she calls medieval-looking options.</p>
    <p>HUTCHISON: Some anti-snoring devices are more medieval than others.</p>
    <p>NEIGHMOND: Prongs to keep nasal passages open, chin straps to literally keep your mouth shut and mouth pieces that hold the lower jaw forward.</p>
    <p>HUTCHISON: I call this the bulldog effect. It's a mouthpiece that's fit for your mouth, and it holds you in a bit of an underbite. And that helps to hold the tongue forward and the jaw forward, which opens up the physical space in the back of the throat.</p>
    <p>NEIGHMOND: The goal of all these devices - decrease congestion in the back of the throat so air flows easily and quietly into the lungs.</p>
    <p>HUTCHISON: One that affects the mouth and chin is a tongue bulb. And that is a silicone suction device that fits over your mouth, and it uses negative pressure to hold your tongue in a forward position while you sleep.</p>
    <p>NEIGHMOND: Opening up the airway in the back of the throat. Snoring is worse when you sleep on your back, so there are a number of ways to get you on your side. A belt with little cushions attached to the back makes it uncomfortable to sleep that way. Body pillows encourage side sleeping. And then there's a device like a dog collar.</p>
    <p>HUTCHISON: Worn around the neck that begin to vibrate when the user turns onto their back. And the vibration slowly increases in intensity.</p>
    <p>NEIGHMOND: Until the snorer turns over. A bit startling, but...</p>
    <p>HUTCHISON: Right up there with getting a big shove from your partner to turn over on your side.</p>
    <p>NEIGHMOND: And if those don't work, Hutchison says you can do what she does. As the wife of a positional snorer, she goes to bed with earplugs. Patti Neighmond, NPR News.</p>
