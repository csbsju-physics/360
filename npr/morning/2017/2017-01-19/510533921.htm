<h1> "'Will & Grace' To Return To NBC" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>OK, Rachel, you know this tune, right?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THEME FROM WILL AND GRACE")</p>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Oh, yeah. That's the theme from "Will And Grace." Of course, the show in the '90s was all groundbreaking and stuff because the main characters were openly gay, right?</p>
    <p>GREENE: And fans of the show were really excited in the fall, when the cast got back together to film this video supporting Hillary Clinton.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO, "OMG! NEW 'WILL AND GRACE' SCENE ABOUT 2016 ELECTION.")</p>
    <p>DEBRA MESSING: (As Grace Adler) Who are you voting for?</p>
    <p>SEAN HAYES: (As Jack McFarland) I don't know, Grace. Maybe I'll stay home on December 1st.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>ERIC MCCORMACK: (As Will Truman) You - you have to vote.</p>
    <p>MESSING: (As Grace Adler) No, it is un-American not to.</p>
    <p>HAYES: (As Jack McFarland) But does my vote even matter? I mean, how can one unemployed white fellow registered in Pennsylvania make a difference?</p>
    <p>GREENE: OK, so it actually didn't matter which candidate you supported. If you liked the show, when you saw this video, you were psyched because you thought, like, maybe the show's going to come back.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Yes, and now, David, the show is coming back.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Good.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: NBC is doing a 10-episode run with the original cast.</p>
    <p>GREENE: And with news so slow these days, you and I are going to have so much time to be able to watch that on television.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Probably not.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Yeah, no.</p>
