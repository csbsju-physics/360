<h1> "Japan's High-Tech Toilets Cause Confusion For Tourists" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. So we kind of have a rule on this program. We try not to talk about toilets or things you don't want to hear about at breakfast, but this is news.</p>
    <p>Japan is making itself more friendly to visitors, and one change - toilets. They have these high-tech functions in Japan - bidets, air-drying, spraying. Tourists would just get confused not knowing what button did what. That problem will now go down the drain. Manufacturers have been told to use a standard set of symbols. Thank goodness. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
