<h1> "Thousands Of Protesters Greet Trump And Congressional Republicans In Philadelphia" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Leading Republicans met yesterday in a Philadelphia hotel. And protesters were on the streets outside defending the Affordable Care Act. Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports.</p>
    <p>BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Sylvia Metzler carried a sign that said, eliminating the ACA would cause 3,425 Pennsylvania residents to die prematurely every year. The figure comes from a study from the left-leaning Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center. Metzler is a retired Philadelphia nurse.</p>
    <p>SYLVIA METZLER: And I had so many patients who didn't have any insurance. And when they got Obamacare, finally, you know, they were able to take care of things.</p>
    <p>ALLYN: She and droves of other protesters rallied around the Republican retreat site, insisting that Trump and other leaders not repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p>
    <p>METZLER: I already know there's too many people who are sick and dying because they don't have decent insurance. And this is just going to make it even worse, and it's criminal.</p>
    <p>ALLYN: Some protesters championed other issues, like Kieran Gusinde-Duffy. He's an activist and Army veteran. He says Trump's critics need to call for Electoral College reforms.</p>
    <p>KIERAN GUSINDE-DUFFY: We don't need a system that rewards people for living in the middle of nowhere and gives them more power to control the government because of that.</p>
    <p>ALLYN: In other words, he thinks the least populous states have the most voting power.</p>
    <p>GUSINDE-DUFFY: That's bogus.</p>
    <p>ALLYN: There were no violent incidents with police, something that satisfied Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross.</p>
    <p>RICHARD ROSS: I don't think there's been any clashes at all. I mean, a lot of these folks have been great in terms of exercising their constitutional right, and we don't have an issue with that.</p>
    <p>ALLYN: Many protesters, meanwhile, vow to keep pressing their cause through demonstrations in the coming weeks.</p>
