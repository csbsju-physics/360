<h1> "New Ghanaian President's Speech Sounds Familiar" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>We are 10 days from Inauguration Day here in Washington. Ghana already had a presidential inauguration last weekend, and it had a surprising resemblance to past inaugurations here in the United States. You really have to listen for yourself to NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton.</p>

    <p>PRESIDENT NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO: And that I will preserve, protect...</p>
    <p>OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Ghana's new president, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo, is a seasoned politician and an articulate public speaker. He's a former foreign and justice minister and a veteran lawyer known to have a way with words in and out of the courtroom. So Ghanians and assembled dignitaries were looking forward to his maiden speech as president.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>AKUFO-ADDO: I stand here today humbled beyond measure for the opportunity to lead this country at this time and take us to a higher level of development.</p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: He did not disappoint - statesmanlike some commentators called the speech - as Akufo Addo reveled in a moment of triumph at his third attempt to become president of Ghana. It was only after Saturday's swearing in that social media lit up with indignation. Why? Well, take a listen.</p>

    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: President Akufo-Addo 2017. Just a tweak in the country but otherwise apparently lifted word for word from President Bill Clinton's inaugural address in 1993. And there's more.</p>

    <p>BUSH: Building communities of service and a nation of character.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>AKUFO-ADDO: Building your communities and our nation.</p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: President Akufo-Addo on Saturday and before him, President George W. Bush inaugural speech 2001. There was a swift Facebook apology from the new Ghanian president's freshly minted communications director. More embarrassment than lasting political or diplomatic damage for Akufo-Addo, say the pundits, but Ghana has egg on its face. Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, NPR News, Johannesburg.</p>
