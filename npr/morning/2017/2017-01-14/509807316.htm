<h1> "A Snowstorm Didn't Stop This LeBron James Fan From Catching The Game" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p>
    <p>And one more sports story left. The NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers and the Portland Trail Blazers played a midseason game this week. January games are not usually considered momentous. But for our friend and Portland-based NPR's sports correspondent, Tom Goldman, and his son, this game was.</p>
    <p>TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Like zillions of kids who play basketball, my son Max loves LeBron James - always has. Even when Steph Curry became the NBA's it guy, Max stayed true to LeBron. But he never saw him play in person. So for Max's recent 18th birthday, I bought two tickets to see LeBron and the Cavaliers this week.</p>
    <p>As the day approached, his excitement was mixed with apprehension. Fans in Memphis recently were furious when James didn't play in a game there. Resting your superstars has become more common and a point of contention in the NBA. But Max and I decided to stay positive, believing LeBron would play. The big day finally came. And so did the snow.</p>

    <p>UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR #1: And there's the cars just littering the roadway that were left last night.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR #2: And those abandoned cars still - yes. Just by the dozens...</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: News stations heralded Portland's biggest snowstorm in 20 years. It brought the city to a screeching halt. But the game was on. And the latest word was everyone would play, including you know who. One problem - our 20 to 30-minute car trip to the arena now was impossible. The light-rail train was an option. But the nearest station was a two to three-hour hike. Who would be crazy enough to do that in the freezing cold and snow?</p>
    <p>Boots?</p>
    <p>MAX: Check.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Warm socks?</p>
    <p>MAX: Two pairs of socks - check.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Gloves?</p>
    <p>MAX: Check.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Tickets?</p>
    <p>MAX: Check.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Tickets right there. It's 2:30. Game's at 7:30.</p>
    <p>MAX: 7:30?</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: We'll try to make it.</p>
    <p>We set out. And, soon, it started snowing again. But with visions of LeBron pulling him forward, Max set a ferocious pace.</p>
    <p>Max, hold on up there. He's a full hundred yards ahead of me. He's actually been jogging a few times uphill.</p>
    <p>The whole first part of the trip had been uphill. We got to the top after an hour and 40 minutes.</p>
    <p>How you feel?</p>
    <p>MAX: Better than ever.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Better than ever? How are your feet? How are your feet?</p>
    <p>MAX: My feet are fine. My legs are kind of sore.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Right. Yeah, but you were running a little bit up there.</p>
    <p>MAX: Yeah. Well, I wanted to get to the top.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Well, hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. One more thing - we can still go back.</p>
    <p>MAX: Never.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: We pressed on and got to the train stop at 4:30, two hours after we set out. The train traveled exactly one block and stopped. A tree had fallen on the tracks. So we got out, walked another 10 city blocks, got on another train. And sooner than you can say frostbite, we were in.</p>
    <p>(CHEERING)</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: About 40 minutes before gametime, fans cheered as LeBron James stepped onto the court to warm up. Max opened his mouth but could only muster sounds.</p>
    <p>MAX: Uh, uh, hey.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: After 10 minutes of gawking and Instagramming from courtside, we headed up to our seats and watched the hometown Blazers pound the Cavaliers, 102-86. Normally, Max would be ecstatic. But on this night, anything Portland did was secondary. LeBron was good, not great - twenty points, 11 rebounds. But he also had five turnovers. No matter - he was there. So was Max. Mission finally accomplished. Tom Goldman, NPR News, Portland.</p>
