    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>Frank Gore of the San Francisco 49ers had a terrible NFC championship game. Sure, he ran for two touchdowns. And yes, his team came back to win and made it to the Super Bowl.

Imagine what your bank account would like if your mom could do that to you.</p>
