<h1> "Ramen Bowl Offers Built-In iPhone Dock" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm RenÃ©e Montagne with a new invention for the lonely diner - a ramen bowl with a built-in iPhone dock. Eating the popular noodle dish normally requires two hands - one for chopsticks, the other for a spoon. Designers at a Taiwanese company noticed a guy trying to do that while juggling his cell phone. So they came up with a way to slurp it up while watching videos or reading emails hands free.</p>
    <p>One flaw - no splash guard for the brothy dish. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
