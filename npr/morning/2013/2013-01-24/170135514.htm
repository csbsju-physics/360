<h1> "Despite Brisk Sales, Apple Has Flat Sales" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>NPR's business news begins with a bite out of Apple.</p>
    <p>It's still the largest tech company in the world - let's make no mistake about that. But Apple reported yesterday that its profits were flat - despite brisk sales of iPhones and iPads. In after-hours trading, Apple's stock plunged, reflecting fears that interest in Apple products may start waning as consumers seek more affordable options.</p>
    <p>Here's NPR's Laura Sydell.</p>
    <p>LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: It's not that consumers didn't buy a lot of iPhones - 11 million more than last year. It also sold tons of iPads. But analysts were expecting more after such exceptional growth in recent years. Apple now faces competition from lower-cost products that comes in different shapes and sizes.</p>
    <p>Speaking during a conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended the size of the iPhone 5, which is smaller than some popular models from the competition.</p>
    <p>TIM COOK CEO, APPLE: It also provides a larger screen size for iPhone customers without sacrificing the one-handed ease of use that our customers love. So we put a lot of thinking into screen size and believe we picked the right one.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Apple also saw a drop in Mac sales. Still, some analysts were not writing Apple off.</p>
    <p>MIKE MCGUIRE: I don't know that I'm ready to call the end of the empire at this point.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Mike McGuire, an analyst at Gartner, says Apple also released a lot of product upgrades before the holiday.</p>
    <p>MCGUIRE: They're growing, having to invest in that growth.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: During yesterday's conference call, Apple's CEO, Cook, also made it clear that the company has new products in the pipeline, adding fire to rumors of an Apple TV set, or a cheaper iPhone. And that could be just what Wall Street needs to see.</p>
