<h1> "25 Years Strong, 'Phantom Of The Opera' Kills And Kills Again" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>It is a musical, sure. But "Phantom of the Opera" is really more of a phenomenon. Last night, the longest running Broadway musical ever, celebrated yet another milestone, its 25th anniversary.</p>
    <p>Broadway's glitterati hit the red carpet for a special performance and reporter Jeff Lunden was there.</p>
    <p>JEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: On January 26, 1988, Ronald Reagan was president of the United States, a gallon of gas cost about 90 cents and a ticket to "The Phantom of the Opera" was a whopping $50. And it was the hottest ticket in town.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC "OVERTURE, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA")</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: Times have changed. Prices have changed. But that disfigured, tortured genius who haunts the Paris Opera House, creating havoc and causing the chandelier to fall, has endured. An invited only-audience, in black tie and gowns, packed the Majestic Theatre last night to celebrate the first show in Broadway history to run for a quarter-century.</p>
    <p>Hal Prince, who's won 21 Tony Awards, including one for directing "Phantom," has his theories about the show's unprecedented success.</p>
    <p>HAL PRINCE: I think the enduring appeal is because it's so romantic and because audiences escape into it. It has a world of its own.</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: And it has those soaring Andrew Lloyd Webber melodies.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MUSIC OF THE NIGHT")</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: The composer couldn't make it to the festivities - he's recovering from back surgery - but he provided a video message.</p>
    <p>ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER: I'd just like to say, I'm missing this. I really wouldn't have missed this for the world. But somebody will bore you with the statistics of the show and how long it's run and all of these sort of things. But it's not going to be me because I've forgotten them.</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: OK, let me try. "The Phantom of the Opera" may be the most successful entertainment franchise of all-time. It has grossed $5.6 billion worldwide - more than "Avatar," more than "Titanic," more than all the "Star Wars" films combined. A staggering 130 million people have seen the show in 28 countries and 148 cities in 13 languages. And did I mention the soaring Andrew Lloyd Webber melodies?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ALL I ASK OF YOU")</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: Soprano Sarah Brightman was married to Lloyd Webber when he was writing "Phantom," and she says he tailored the ingenue role of Christine just for her.</p>
    <p>: And I'd sort of lead him through various things I knew. And together we - well, really, he created everything. But I think I was definitely a muse at that time.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ALL I ASK OF YOU")</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: Brightman, wearing a silver tiara, was one of the guests of honor. After the performance, director Hal Prince and producer Cameron Mackintosh emceed a little ceremony, which invited the cast, orchestra and crew of "Phantom," as well as dozens of former cast members to take a bow. Four actors, who've played the Phantom in New York, London, Stockholm and Toronto, took the stage to sing a couple of songs.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MUSIC OF THE NIGHT")</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: Then the guests went to the New York Public Library for a big anniversary party. But come Monday night, "Phantom" goes back to the business of breaking the longest-running Broadway musical record with every performance.</p>
