<h1> "Not-So-Clean Energy Efforts In Italy Under Investigation" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Fracking may be a dirty word in the U.S., but in Italy, even so-called clean energy - wind and solar power - isn't so clean these days.</p>

    <p>MARTIN: The Washington Post reported this week that the Italian Mafia controls a sizeable portion of Italy's thriving renewable energy industry. Probably because it's one of the country's fastest growing businesses. Another reason - the billions of euros in subsidies that the Italian government shells out for wind farms and solar power plants.</p>

    <p>MARTIN: Guess which part of Italy gets the most sun and wind? Sicily, which also happens to be home to some of Italy's most powerful crime families.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Italian government launched a series of sting operations, seizing as many as one third of Sicily's wind farms, along with a number of its solar power plants. They've also arrested more than 10 alleged crime bosses.</p>
    <p>The investigation is ongoing. Still, you have to marvel at Italy's Mafia dons for their ability to adapt and innovate. As one Mafia member who was caught in a government wiretap is reported to have said, quote, "For the love of our sons, renewable energy is important. It's a business we can live on."</p>
    <p>But Sicily's energy minister says, what's been good for the mob hasn't been good for Italy. Criminal organizations were allowed to do business, he said. We lost a vital opportunity for development and the region lost a chance to profit from it.</p>
