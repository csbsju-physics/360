<h1> "Inauguration Swag Floods The Market" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>And today's last word in business is swag. The presidential inauguration is days away, and that means a lot of commemorative merchandise is about to flood the market.</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>The online retailer Cafe Press is happy to sell you an inaugural mouse pad, or a shot glass, or a mug with the president's mug. And the merchandise is bipartisan. That includes a sweatshirt with the message: I was Anti-Obama Before It Was Cool.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Cafe Press keeps track of which items sell better. Since the election, 55 percent of the merchandise sold has been pro-Obama. That 55 percent is right around the president's approval rating lately, but it's also down sharply from 85 percent pro-Obama merchandise sold four years ago.</p>
