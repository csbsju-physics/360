<h1> "Remembering Public Television's Huell Howser" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>In Southern California fans gathered yesterday to say goodbye to a regional icon, Huell Howser. He was a host of popular travel shows on PBS, focusing on the charms of his adopted state, California and gaining a huge following with a camcorder and an aw-shucks Southern drawl.</p>
    <p>HUELL HOWSER: Well, hello everybody. I'm Huell Howser. And you know over the years, we have done literally thousands of stories about all kinds of subjects all over this state.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Howser died earlier this month of cancer.</p>
    <p>NPR's Shereen Marisol Meraji was at yesterday's memorial and has this story.</p>
    <p>SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, BYLINE: Hundreds braved L.A. traffic and unseasonably cold weather to say goodbye to a man who took them to places they never knew they wanted to go, and introduced them to people they never knew they wanted to meet.</p>
    <p>CHARLES PHOENIX: His name was Huell Burnley Howser. Don't we love the name Burnley? We never knew. He never said, Hi, I'm Huell Burnley Howser.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MERAJI: That's L.A. pop culture historian Charles Phoenix, talking about the Tennessee native who thought every thing about California was...</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Amazing.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Would you look at that?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Wow.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: That's amazing.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MERAJI: Impressions like those were rampant at yesterday's tribute. Because Huell Howser was known for finding the amazing in the ordinary, and he did it for over 30 years.</p>

    <p>HOWSER: Oh, boy.</p>
    <p>MERAJI: Random state park in California nobody visits.</p>
    <p>HOWSER: Oh, my gosh.</p>
    <p>MERAJI: An Italian Grocery store with a massive soda pop selection.</p>
    <p>HOWSER: Amazing.</p>
    <p>MATT GROENING: Well, at first, you know, you think, oh this guy - he's an idiot. You know...</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>GROENING: ...he's so naive, he's amazed at everything. And then you realize, he's a genius</p>
    <p>MERAJI: Matt Groening created "The Simpsons" and is a self-proclaimed...</p>
    <p>GROENING: Friend of Huell Howser.</p>
    <p>MERAJI: Groening said what was genius about Huell was his authenticity and he wrote him into the show.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SERIES, "THE SIMPSONS")</p>
    <p>GROENING: In this world of cynicism and pseudo-sophistication, a guy who's willing to be genuine is really refreshing. And everybody on "The Simpsons" writing staff - and I got to tell you, those are a bunch of cynical people...</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>GROENING: ...genuinely loved him.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF A SONG, "CALIFORNIA HERE I COME")</p>
    <p>MERAJI: The hundreds of fans who genuinely loved Huell Howser finished yesterday's tribute singing along to his version of "California, Here I Come."</p>
    <p>In California, a giant state with every language, culture, and sub-culture you can think of Howser was one of the few common denominators. And you could see that in yesterday's turn-out.</p>
    <p>Maybe it's because he never complained about the traffic or the smog. He just reminded us every single day why this place is so awesome. Or as he would say: Amazing.</p>
