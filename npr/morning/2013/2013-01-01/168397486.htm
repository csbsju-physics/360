<h1> "Hobby Lobby Plans To Defy Health Care Mandate" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>This New Year could mean a new cost for the craft store chain Hobby Lobby. The federal health care law requires employee insurance plans to cover emergency contraceptives. Hobby Lobby's owners did not want to do that. They say drugs commonly known by names like the morning-after pill are tantamount to abortion.</p>
    <p>Now, the Supreme Court has turned aside Hobby Lobby's request to block the mandate. So, starting today, the company could be fined as much as $1.3 million per day for defying the law.</p>
