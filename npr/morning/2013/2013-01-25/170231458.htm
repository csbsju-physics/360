<h1> "In China, James Bond Is Censored Not Stirred" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>In today's last word in business is: censored, not stirred.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "SKYFALL")</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>The new Bond film "Skyfall" is now playing in the world's second-largest movie market - that would be China - and some 007 fans are furious about the nips and tucks Chinese censors have made to the movie.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The Wall Street Journal reports that censors edited some scenes - scenes involving prostitutes, as well as politics, and a scene where Chinese character is shot by a hit man. All this has led to a conspiracy theory spreading on the Internet. The theory is that Chinese officials may have changed the movie to make it less interesting and therefore less of a box office threat to domestic movies.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Well, if there is a conspiracy, it doesn't look like it's working. On Chinese social media sites, many commented that they just buy pirated versions of the original, uncensored movie and watch it at home.</p>
