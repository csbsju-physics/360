    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Let's take a moment to remember the writer Richard Ben Cramer. He died Monday in Baltimore of complications from lung cancer at the age of 62.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Cramer's books include a 1,000-page work on the 1988 presidential campaign, called "What It Takes."</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Though it was panned at first, it became essential reading for anyone learning about politics. He profiled candidates like Bob Dole, Michael Dukakis and George H.W. Bush.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: With rare depth and energy, Cramer tracked the lifelong struggles that drove one man to the White House and drove other candidates excruciatingly close before they came away with nothing. He wrote of the way a losing candidate is thrown back on himself and forced to find a way to go on.</p>
