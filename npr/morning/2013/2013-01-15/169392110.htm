    <p>NPR's business news starts with a Wal-Mart plan to hire veterans.</p>
    <p>OK, we've heard elsewhere in the program about corporate recruiters seeking out veterans. Today, Wal-Mart announces it will hire every veteran who wants a job. It's part of a new program beginning on Memorial Day. The only requirements here are that the veteran left the military in the previous year and that the veteran was not dishonorably discharged.</p>
    <p>This Wal-Mart plan is expected to lead to jobs for more than 100,000 people over the next five years.</p>
