<h1> "Profit-Sharing Checks Replace Autoworkers Raises" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>The Ford Motor Company also announced its earnings yesterday, saying it had a pre-tax profit of $8 billion for 2012. And that gives union employees a reason to celebrate. They will each get a profit sharing check of $8,300 - a record high amount.</p>
    <p>There's also some good news coming for General Motors workers, as Michigan Radio's Tracy Samilton reports.</p>
    <p>TRACY SAMILTON, BYLINE: GM hasn't announced earnings yet, but the company was roughly as profitable as Ford in the first nine months last year. So unless GM's fourth quarter tanked - which no one expects - its union workers will get big checks, too.</p>
    <p>Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research says it's a welcome source of income, even though profit-sharing has permanently replaced what many workers like even better - a raise.</p>
    <p>KRISTIN DZICZEK: We have to, you know, balance this $8,300 check against eight years of no annual wage increase. Costs have gone up in eight years.</p>
    <p>SAMILTON: The check makes the biggest difference for entry-level workers, representing nearly 25 percent of their regular earnings. As to what workers tend to do with the checks - it runs the gamut, from paying bills to a down payment for a car made in their own factory.</p>
    <p>Mike McKenzie is with Royal Oak Ford.</p>
    <p>MIKE MCKENZIE: A lot of times people have been waiting for that profit-sharing check. Hopefully that means more car sales for us.</p>
    <p>SAMILTON: And more car sales means more profits for the automakers.</p>
    <p>Chrysler workers can expect profit-sharing checks, too, but they won't be as sizable. That's because the smallest of the Detroit three is also generating the smallest profits.</p>
