<h1> "A Cooler Roof For A New 'Cat'" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>There are certain classic American plays that are revived on Broadway every decade or so, to let a new generation of audiences and actors discover them. Tennessee Williams' 1955 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," is one of those. Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson headlines a new revival, which opens tonight.</p>
    <p>Jeff Lunden has more.</p>
    <p>JEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: The last time Scarlett Johansson played on Broadway, which was also her first time, she won a Tony Award as the young niece, Catherine, who unwittingly sets a tragedy in motion in Arthur Miller's "A View from the Bridge." The 28-year-old star, who's fresh off last summer's blockbuster movie, "The Avengers," wanted to return to the stage and read through a lot of plays. Then she came to "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."</p>
    <p>SCARLETT JOHANSSON: When I read it, I was just terrified of it. And I think that's why I chose to do it.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>JOHANSSON: I didn't know how to do to it but I knew I could do it. So that interested me.</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: Johansson's stepping into a role, and a silky slip, that many actresses have made famous: Barbara Bel Geddes in the original production, Elizabeth Taylor in the film, Kathleen Turner and Elizabeth Ashley, among others, in Broadway revivals. But Johansson sees Maggie the Cat a little differently.</p>
    <p>JOHANSSON: She's not a slinky, sort of, sex kitten. She's earthy and she's ugly at times. And, you know, she's the ugly truth at times, for better or worse. And, you know, that's how I see her in my mind.</p>

    <p>LUNDEN: Director Rob Ashford, who's well-known in New York for his work in musicals, has directed revivals of classic American plays in London. He gathered a cast that includes rising star Benjamin Walker as Brick and Irish actor CiarÃ¡n Hinds as Big Daddy. Ashford says he wanted to direct this drama of family secrets and dysfunction with new eyes.</p>
    <p>ROB ASHFORD: You know, when we started rehearsal, one of the first things I said to them was, like, if could take these characters off these pedestals where they've been placed and just, kind of, put them back in the play; let's make that our goal. Like, not someone giving their Big Daddy, or someone giving their Maggie or someone giving their Brick, but just like these characters in a play.</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: Benjamin Walker says Ashford's fresh perspective helped him tackle the role of Brick, the alcoholic ex-jock, who's lost his best friend Skipper.</p>
    <p>: A lot of people always, you know, Oh, it's the play where the guy doesn't know he's gay. And it's just more complicated than that, sexuality is much more complicated than that. And what we learn about these people is much more complicated than that. And I think what Rob has done is to embrace those complexities that are already in the play. And I think that'll surprise people.</p>

    <p>LUNDEN: The unhappy, childless marriage between Brick and Maggie, is brought into focus in the play by a 65th birthday celebration for Brick's cantankerous father, Big Daddy, who owns a huge cotton plantation and is dying of cancer - though the other characters keep that fact hidden from him.</p>
    <p>One of Tennessee Williams' biggest themes in this play is mendacity.</p>

    <p>LUNDEN: Belfast-born actor CiarÃ¡n Hinds plays Big Daddy.</p>
    <p>: All the way through, they talk about lying and liars. And they're spoken of with such disgust and disdain, and yet we all live our live by lies and small lies, white lies - either for our own nefarious reasons or to prevent people from getting hurt by the truth. And that's what seems to me is the big heart of this play, and who can face up to the lies and liars.</p>
    <p>And the character that I play, Big Daddy, is the one who is the first one to stand up and say all my life I've been hampered and held back by liars and the hypocrisy of it. But when it comes to facing his own truth, which is delivered to him very simply and very devastatingly by his son, he's got nothing more to say.</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: Director Rob Ashford says all the painful truths are wrapped in uncommonly beautiful language by Tennessee Williams.</p>
    <p>ASHFORD: There's so much poetry with the pain. Do you know what I mean? It's all like, kind of, if life is going to be brutal, then let's have a little beauty with the brutality.</p>
    <p>LUNDEN: "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" opens at the Richard Rodgers Theatre tonight and runs through March 30th.</p>
