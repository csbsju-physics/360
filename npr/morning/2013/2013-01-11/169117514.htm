<h1> "International Twitter War Becomes An Opera" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>And today's last word in business is being set to music. Truth really is stranger than fiction, which is how a TV interview with President Richard Nixon could become a famous play, and how The New Yorker writer Lawrence Wright could create a forthcoming play on the Camp David accords. Now, an international Twitter war is becoming an opera.</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Last summer, The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman criticized the economic austerity of Estonia.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The Estonian president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, was furious.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: He went on Twitter to declare, quote, "Let's write about something we know nothing about and be smug, overbearing and patronizing." More presidential tweets followed - some, laced with profanity.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Now, a composer and a financial journalist have teamed up to produce an opera based on this exchange. The verbal fireworks can now be sung - something like, you know, (Singing) You're overbearing, patronizing, you know nothing....</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: (LAUGHTER) Well, it will only last 15 minutes, though, when it premieres in Estonia this April.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF HABANERA FROM OPERA "CARMEN")</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Oh, that's beautiful. And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
