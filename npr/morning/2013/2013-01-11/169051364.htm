<h1> "Mother To Daughter: 'That's When I Knew I Was Adopted' " </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>And it's time now for StoryCorps, the project recording the stories of everyday Americans. And today, we're going to hear from Diane Tells His Name. She's a Lakota Indian. Growing up, she never knew anything about her heritage. She was adopted when she was a baby. And at StoryCorps, her daughter, Bonnie Buchanan, asks Diane about her childhood.</p>
    <p>BONNIE BUCHANAN: When did you first feel like you were different?</p>
    <p>DIANE TELLS HIS NAME: Probably elementary school. I had a younger sister, and I really didn't like doing the same things that she would do. She would do tea parties and play with dolls, and things like that; and I was always outside, looking at the clouds or the stars. And my sister was blond, tall and thin, like my mother; and I was round and brown.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>TELLS HIS NAME: I remember going through the family albums, looking for my face in the old photographs, and I didn't see me.  And eventually, when I was 37 years old, I happened to see a picture of my mom in October of 1951. And it shocked me because I was born in November of 1951 - and my mother was not pregnant. So that's when I knew that I was adopted.</p>
    <p>BUCHANAN: How did you feel?</p>
    <p>TELLS HIS NAME: It was very satisfying to know that I wasn't crazy. I didn't blame them. I wasn't angry with them. In 1951, you just didn't talk about those things. So when I got my original birth certificate, it said on there my birth mother's name; and it said that she was born at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. So I went to South Dakota to receive my Indian name, and get a crash course in how to be Indian.</p>
    <p>After that, my husband and I told Indian Family Services we wanted to adopt a child from my tribe, a Lakota child. And finally, they faxed us a picture of a little Indian child, and she was drinking chocolate syrup out of a Hershey's bottle. And our son said, that's her! That's the one we need to adopt. And it was you.</p>
    <p>BUCHANAN: (LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>TELLS HIS NAME: I started doing research on your family, and when I started looking at your family tree, I saw one of my relatives on your paper. So we are cousins. I thought that was just - that was amazing. I'm glad you're my baby.</p>
    <p>BUCHANAN: I know. I'm glad you adopted me.</p>
    <p>TELLS HIS NAME: I am, too. It's like our whole family was just planned out so that it would be best for all of us.</p>
