<h1> "Kid Convinced He Bought $50,000 Car On eBay" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. Don't play with the iPad if Mom tells you not to, especially if Mom's a prankster. Eight-year-old Kenyon was looking at a car on eBay. Mom told him he accidentally bought it for $50,000.</p>
    <p>KENYON: Is that true? Did I?</p>
    <p>MOM: I'm afraid so.</p>
    <p>GREENE: She posted his reaction on YouTube.</p>
    <p>KENYON: It was a Mustang. I didn't mean to buy it.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Mom quickly came clean and said her family laughs with and sometimes at each other. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
