    <p>Patti Page was born Clara Ann Fowler in Oklahoma in 1927, one of 11 children. She grew up in the years of the Depression and World War Two. And as a teenager, she appeared on a radio show sponsored by the Page Milk Company. The regular Page-singer was out and so she took the name and kept it, and went on to record a series of hits.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DOGGIE IN THE WINDOW")</p>
    <p>PAGE: (Singing) How Much is that doggie in the window?</p>
    <p>(Singing) The one with the waggily tail. How much...</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The woman who took her name from the Page Milk Company radio show eventually had her own "Patti Page Show" on network TV. In 1999, she finally won a Grammy Award for a live recording at Carnegie Hall, "Practice, Practice, Practice."</p>
    <p>GREENE: Her death comes amid plans to award her a Lifetime Achievement Grammy. A singer who worked with her, George Jones, remembers her by saying, she hit notes I never dreamed of.</p>
