    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. The inaugural parade will have floats and marching bands, and for science geeks a special treat - life-size replicas of the NASA Mars rover, Curiosity, and the Orion space capsule.

He told Wired magazine he'll reveal a special new hairstyle just for today's parade. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
