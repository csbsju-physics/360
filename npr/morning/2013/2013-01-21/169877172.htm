    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: OK, last year, the United States government shut down the file-sharing website Megaupload over charges of copyright infringement. That was a popular place for users to share pirated films and music. Over the weekend, the founder of Megaupload, the New Zealand tycoon Kim Dotcom, launched a successor to the site. It's called simply Mega.</p>
    <p>The U.S. Justice Department has not commented yet, though the film industry has raised concerns here. The new site already claims to have over one million users.</p>
