<h1> "Wife's Phone Call Interupts Soccer News Conference" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. A Scottish sports reporter recorded a soccer team press conference using his phone. Great idea, but inevitably the reporter's phone rang. The soccer team manager picked it up.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Hello?</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: It was the reporter's wife, who hung up in confusion, but then called again. And the manager answered again.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Sharon? Sharon. Sharon. You've got to stop interrupting my press conference, please.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
