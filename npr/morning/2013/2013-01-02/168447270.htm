    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. Developer Richard Marin says he's building the world's largest Ferris Wheel. It's planned for the shore of New York City's Staten Island. It's part of a larger development which is going ahead even though critics noted is partly in a flood zone. Flooding from Hurricane Sandy prompted Mr. Marin to make only minor adjustments. He says the project is a boon for Staten Island, and in fairness, the top of the Ferris Wheel will be above any storm surge. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
