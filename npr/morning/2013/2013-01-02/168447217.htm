<h1> "Bird Sighting Record Broken In Canada" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, Iâm David Greene with a record that's for the birds. Twenty-two-year-old Josh Vandermeulen is happy as a lark about the record he set for number of birds sighted in Ontario, Canada. He drove thousands of miles to see 344 different bird species this year, six more than the previous record.</p>

    <p>It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
