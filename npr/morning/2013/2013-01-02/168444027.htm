    <p>GREENE: You might remember over the holiday season, we delved into some of the tax credit lawmakers were considering changing as part of a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. We called it our 12 Days of Deductions.</p>
    <p>Well, now with Congress giving the green light to an agreement that avoids widespread tax increases, we know where some of those credits stand. The deal provides a five-year extension of the earned income tax credit - that's an important one for lower income families. It also extends the child tax credit.</p>
    <p>The law passed last night also provides a tax credit of up to $2,500 for college tuition.</p>
