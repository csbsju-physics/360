    <p>NPR's business news starts with job cuts on Wall Street.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The investment bank Morgan Stanley has announced plans to shed 1,600 jobs - about half of those cuts here in the United States. The layoffs are said to target senior employees, management and executives - a move seen as aimed at cutting costs and boosting equity returns for the banks' investors. Those returns are still down about a quarter from the levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
