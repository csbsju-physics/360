<h1> "Principal Wants To Be Up On The Roof" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>To find the principal of Wrightsville Elementary in York, Pennsylvania, you might have to look on the roof. Students of Don Gillett are in a program tracking books they read. If they total 2,000 books in the next few months, he says he'll get a tent and a grill and live on the roof for a while. He's even involved the local baseball team. The more they win, the longer he'll stay up there.</p>
    <p>You can't help but wonder if the principal secretly wants to spend a little bit of time above it all.</p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
