    <p>OK. So, China's economy is cooling, but it's still one of the fastest growing markets for Starbucks. Our last word in business today is all the coffee in China. The big Chinese New Year's holiday is this Monday. So, Starbucks is trying to tap in to patriotic palates by rolling out a new blend that includes beans grown in China. The company says it's been working with growers in southwestern China, an area that's known for coffee production. It's not to save money, Starbucks says. It wants local beans on the menu, of course, in hopes of bringing in more customers. A spokeswoman describes the new blend as having gentle acidity, a soft herbal flavor and a cocoa taste. That's the business news on Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
