<h1> "Obama Not First President To Have Oath Do-Over" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. The White House emphasized that President Obama took his oath a second time out of an abundance of caution. Back in 1923, Calvin Coolidge seems to have really needed his do-over. The then vice president was at his father's farm in Vermont, when President Warren G. Harding suddenly died. Coolidge's father, a justice of the peace, quickly swore his son in as president. It turned out that authority applied only to taking office in Vermont. It's Morning Edition. </p>
