    <p>INSKEEP: Millions of Time Warner cable subscribers get to keep their favorite channels. Time Warner says it has resolved a dispute with the media conglomerate Viacom. The two companies had been fighting over fee hikes for some of the most popular networks, including Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon.  </p>
    <p>Viacom was threatening to pull the networks by New Year's Eve if its demands were not met. No more Jon Stewart, no more "Real World: Brooklyn." No more "Dora the Explorer." But at a last minute deal just after midnight that probably saved the lives of some parents, the two companies reached an agreement.  </p>
