<h1> "Egg-Shipment Crash Results In A Highway Omelet" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. A truck driver fell asleep near Detroit overnight and woke up to scrambled eggs. The tractor-trailer crashed into a guardrail, and the truckload of egg cartons spilled onto the highway. In fact the eggs covered three lanes of highway along a distance of 300 feet, and of course the broken eggs froze in place. Cleanup crews used the closest thing they had to a giant spatula, a front-end loader. You're listening to Morning Edition. </p>
