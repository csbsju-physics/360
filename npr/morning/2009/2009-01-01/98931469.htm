<h1> "Giant Chicken Nugget Rings In The New Year" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host:  </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Of all the New Year's celebrations, the tastiest might have come in McDonough, Georgia. The town along Interstate 75 attracted thousands of people last night. Instead of watching a giant crystal ball like Times Square, they watched a giant chicken nugget drop into a vat of dipping sauce. The nugget weighs 800 pounds. It's only made of plaster, though a manager at the restaurant that hosts the event says, it looks real. You're listening to Morning Edition. </p>
