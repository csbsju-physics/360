<h1> "Hawaiian Drill Team Chills Out For Inauguration" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. The drill team at Barack Obama's old high school in Honolulu can't take that Aloha weather with them when they march down chilly Pennsylvania Avenue for his inauguration. So, the Punahou School marchers will be rehearsing on Hawaii's one and only ice rink, at Honolulu's Ice Palace. </p>
    <p>And Americans caught in London on Inauguration Day can still get a look at the new president at Madame Tussauds wax museum. On that day, Americans get in for free. It's Morning Edition. </p>
