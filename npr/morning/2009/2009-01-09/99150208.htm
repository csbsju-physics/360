<h1> "Rare Baseball Card Almost Sold On eBay" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Ari Shapiro. Seventy-two-year-old Bernice Gallego found an old baseball card and posted it on eBay for $10, from the Red Stocking BB Club of Cincinnati. She'd never heard of the team. Turns out, it's 140 years old and considered one of the first baseball cards ever made. It could be worth more than $100,000. One collector said it's like unearthing a Picasso. Gallego told the Fresno Bee, I don't thing I've ever been to a baseball game. It's Morning Edition. </p>
