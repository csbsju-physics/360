<h1> "Get Paid For Lounging Around Great Barrier Reef" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business is about a job opening for what may be the best job in the world. That's what the employer calls it. The Australian state of Queensland, home to the famous Great Barrier Reef, is looking for an island caretaker. Shana Pereira is with the tourist authority there.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: It's a live-in position with flexible working hours, and the key responsibilities include exploring the islands of the Great Barrier Reef to discover and promote to an international audience what the islands have to offer.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Basically, you stroll around the sand, soak up the sun, swim, snorkel, and blog about it. The blogging is the work which pays - for a six-month contract - 100,000 U.S. dollars.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Where do I apply for that?</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: I knew you're going to say that. I'm ahead of you in line, Steve.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: I'm writing an application now.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Strangely enough, only about 150 people have applied so far.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Renee, would you write my letter of recommendation?</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Well, yeah, as soon as this - we've got a couple of more seconds here, and then I'll get to it.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: We'll talk about it afterward. All right.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: That's the business news on Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
