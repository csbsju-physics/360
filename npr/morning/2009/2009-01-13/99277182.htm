<h1> "Giant Lobster Granted Reprieve, Freed In Maine" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne with news of a fresh start for a very old lobster. The 20-pound lobster has been in a tank at a New York restaurant since he was caught a couple of weeks ago. Now known as George, the giant lobster had been posing for pictures with customers. Experts say 20 pounds makes George ancient - somewhere between 80 and 140. That's one reason the restaurant allowed the animal rights group PETA to return old George to the sea. It's Morning Edition.</p>
