<h1> "Snowball Fight Good Fun, No Record Set" </h1>

    <p>Good morning, I'm Linda Wertheimer. It could have been a record-setting battle in the frozen north. Four thousand people signed up on Facebook for the University of Wisconsin, Madison's snowball fight. But only hundreds showed up. There was a basketball game, the snow was too powdery to pack, it was really cold. So Michigan Tech still holds the snowball record, but there is snow in the forecast. It's Morning Edition.</p>
