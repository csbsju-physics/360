<h1> "Chicago Boy Poses As Police Officer" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. A 14-year-old boy in Chicago is charged with impersonating a police officer. Apparently that's what he wanted to be, but he didn't wait to grow up. The teenager wore a uniform into a police station and got assigned to a patrol car. Chicago police officials say he looked a lot older. The aspiring police officer never got a gun or issued any tickets. He was spotted as a fake only after his five-hour patrol ended on Saturday. It's Morning Edition.</p>
