    <p>MONTAGNE: Pfizer is the world's largest drug maker, and it could soon become bigger. Pfizer has announced plans to buy another large drug maker, Wyeth. It's paying $68 million in stock and cash to scoop up its rival. If the deal goes through, it will be one of the biggest pharmaceutical mergers in the last decade. Drug makers have been consolidating to try to reduce costs and expand their offerings. The patents on many lucrative drugs are set to expire over the next few years and that includes Pfizer's cholesterol-fighting pill Lipitor and Viagra. This merger will allow Pfizer to acquire Wyeth's top-selling childhood vaccine and also a popular treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
