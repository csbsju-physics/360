    <p>Today's last word in business is a way to save money and maybe help the environment. A Dutch company called Sprank has found a way to make your printer cartridge last longer. It's a new font that the company says uses 20 percent less ink. Here's how they do it. The ecofont, as it's called, is made with tiny holes in the letters. The company tried using striped or thin letters first, but the font wasn't readable. The company's co-founder admits the font is not beautiful but says it works, and it's available for download for free. We're doing something similar here at NPR. Our printers now no longer use vowels. And that's the Business News on Morning Edition from NPR Nws (ph) . I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
