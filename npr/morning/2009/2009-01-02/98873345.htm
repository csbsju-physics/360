<h1> "A Snow-Day Experience That Got Frozen In Time" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>It is Friday morning, which means, among other things, that it's time again for StoryCorps, the national project capturing the stories of everyday Americans, including this one. In 1951, a massive blizzard hit the southern United States, blanketing the region with ice and snow. At the time, Jim Fleming was a high-school student in Greenwood, Mississippi, and he recalls how he occupied his time during the snow days.</p>
    <p>D: But now here's the corollary to that story. When I got to Vanderbilt in my freshman year, we studied biology. When it came time for the final exam, I sat down; there was a question said, write the animal kingdom. And I sat down and wrote that blue book, wrote it full. A couple of days later, Dr. Farrell called me in. He said, no one can write the animal kingdom like that; you copied out of a book. I said, no, Dr. Farrell, I did not. So, he says, sit down right here and show me.</p>

    <p>D: So, I wrote the animal kingdom. By that time, you know, I knew it very well.</p>

    <p>D: And when I got into practice, I got a call one night from the Vanderbilt Emergency Room. So, I got over there and assessed this girl and said, you know, I need to take her to surgery. Nurse said, well, you need to talk to her father. So, I went out there to talk to the father, and there was Dr. Farrell. And he looked at me and he said, animal kingdom, aren't you, boy?</p>

    <p>D: He said, well, you're OK; you go ahead and operate on my daughter.</p>
