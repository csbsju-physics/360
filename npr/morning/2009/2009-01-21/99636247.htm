<h1> "Antigua To Rename Mountain After Obama" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. We do not know if this will improve its case for foreign aid, but the island of Antigua has confirmed it will rename its tallest peak. This summer, the mountain will become known as Mount Obama, 1300 feet high. It happens August 4th, the birthday of the person who gets the honor. The new president can only hope that the mountain's old name contains no symbolism for his agenda, because up to now, the mountain has been known as Boggy Peak. You're listening to Morning Edition.</p>
