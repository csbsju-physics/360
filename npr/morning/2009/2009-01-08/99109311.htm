<h1> "Nigerian Motorcycle Riders Dislike New Helmet Law" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. Nigeria's famous con-artists and thieves seem immune to the law, possibly because police there are too busy arresting people in funny hats. Helmets are now required on Nigeria's wild motorcycle taxis. So riders are opting for less expensive options - cooking pots, tire rubber, and huge gourds tied with string. Besides drivers, Reuters reports police have arrested scores of passengers who say they fear helmets carry disease or black magic. It's Morning Edition. </p>
