    <p>And our last word in business today is more of a last note. It's Johannes Brahms' First Symphony.  </p>

    <p>SHAPIRO: The Berlin Philharmonic performed this work on Tuesday, and they streamed it live over the Internet. It's the first performance in the Philharmonic's new digital concert hall. Now you can buy tickets to watch performances live online, or for $14 you can access the music anytime within two days of the broadcast. You can also buy season tickets for about $200 and watch all of their performances from anywhere in the world.  </p>
    <p>All you need is a computer and an Internet connection, although a flat screen TV and surround-sound speakers certainly wouldn't hurt. That's the business news on Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Ari Shapiro. </p>
