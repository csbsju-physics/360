<h1> "Obama Gets A New Armored Presidential Limousine" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Ari Shapiro. President-elect Barack Obama may inherit his predecessor's wars, his deficits and his address, but he will not have to ride in George W. Bush's car. During the inauguration, Mr. Obama will cruise down Pennsylvania Avenue with a brand new 2009 Cadillac presidential limousine. This model has bigger windows than the old one. It's made by General Motors, and if GM could just get a few million more people to buy one, maybe they wouldn't need that government bailout. It's Morning Edition. </p>
