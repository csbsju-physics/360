<h1> "Weaving Words For The Inaugural Poem" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, host: </p>
    <p>Poet Elizabeth Alexander was asked to write an original poem for the inauguration. The African-American studies professor from Yale, and friend of President-elect Obama, joins us now from New York. Ms. Alexander, thanks so much for being with us. </p>
    <p>Prof. ELIZABETH ALEXANDER (English Language/Literature, African-American Literature and Gender Studies, Yale University; Poet, Essayist, Playwright): I'm pleased to be with you. </p>
    <p>SIMON: So, is it done? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: The poem is done, yes. That does not mean that there may not be a last-minute fiddle or tweak, but it is - it is fundamentally done. </p>
    <p>SIMON: So, can we, like, hear it? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: No, you can't. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: You have to wait until the 20th. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: And then you get the whole thing. </p>
    <p>SIMON: I was hoping to catch you unawares. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: I'm guarding it like a mother tiger. </p>
    <p>SIMON: I remember reading once, a number of years ago, that Robert Frost, who's one of this very illustrious, short category of poets who have read previous inaugurations, he'd written his poem - or said he had written his poem - on a pad of paper that he was balancing on his foot, he wrote his poem. May I ask, paper, pen, computer - how do you write? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: I begin often with scraps of paper because poems for me begin when I'm in the midst of doing the things that I do on regular days - teaching, picking up my children, making dinner. I always have pen and paper nearby because in the meditative snatches of time in the midst of the day, I find that many, many, many phrases often come to me. And then once I have some clear time to myself, that's when I gather the scraps and see what's there, and see what has a life that goes beyond the fragment. After I've drafted it on legal pad, that's when it goes into the computer. </p>
    <p>SIMON: And may I ask, this poem you're going to read at the inauguration, did you have to run it by anybody? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: No, isn't that extraordinary? I did not, and I think that that says something about believing that what artists bring that folks need and can use. </p>
    <p>SIMON: Have you chosen to run it by anybody whose opinion you respect and want? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: My husband is the person who always hears my poems, and he gives me the big thumbs up or the big thumbs down, and so we've gone through our usual ritual. </p>
    <p>SIMON: In your mind now, what do this mean for you to share this moment, and to help embody this moment in America? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: It is profoundly humbling. What this day means to so many people and the power of that emotion is something that I've really tried to respect and consider. This is a day that reminds us of all of the work that there is ahead, but it's also a day of a very, very sober and powerful joy. And so that has kept me sober myself. </p>
    <p>SIMON: I don't want to be responsible for instilling you with even more anxiety, if that's what you're feeling. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>SIMON: But... </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: I'll keep it together. </p>
    <p>SIMON: The audience will be, I assume, in the billions. </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: Mm-hmm. </p>
    <p>SIMON: And your words will be quoted for decades, centuries. </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: Well, that's right. And so, when faced with the literally unimaginable - I mean, really, who can imagine that? None of us, nobody can imagine that. It just took me back to what I already know about how to approach a poem. You're looking at a blank page. You are humbled before the muse. You hope that she will help you. You make a million false starts. I can't tell you how many crossings out and excisions and overwriting and then cutting back, I mean, you know, the drafting process just went on and on and on because what I did know - and this as regards your question - is that I had to feel that I had absolutely done my very best and then some. So I did give it my very best and then some. </p>
    <p>SIMON: And without imparting anything to us or in any way destroying the magic of discovery, is your poem about the president, about the country? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: Well, it's hard to say what the "about of" is in this poem. Is the word Obama in it? No. I can tell you that. It's not about the president in that way. But I do think that it's about this very, very, very extraordinary moment that I really see as a collective moment, and about trying to strike a tone that keeps us aware that a lot of work and sacrifice brought us here, and that that's what we need to keep doing to move forward. </p>
    <p>SIMON: And may I ask, in conclusion, does it rhyme? </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: There are some rhymes in it. I'm not trying to evade your question, but there are some rhymes in it. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: Wait and see. </p>
    <p>SIMON: OK. </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: Be surprised. </p>
    <p>SIMON: All right, All right. I will. </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: OK. </p>
    <p>SIMON: Elizabeth Alexander, who will read her poem at the inauguration of President Obama on Tuesday. Ms. Alexander, so nice talking to you. </p>
    <p>Prof. ALEXANDER: You, too. Thank you very much for your questions. </p>
    <p>SIMON: And if you're braving the cold and crowds of Washington, D.C., or you're simply watching Barack Obama's inauguration at home, we'd like you to share your experience.
