<h1> "A Pop-Up Inauguration Celebration" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, host: </p>
    <p>Carol Barton is a pop-up book specialist who has come up with a way for children to participate in the inauguration without worrying about parking, walking or diapers. Ms. Barton is the author of "The Pocket Paper Engineer," and she has created a do-it-yourself inauguration pop-up that's appearing in the pages of the Washington Post. Carol Barton joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us. </p>
    <p>Ms. CAROL BARTON (Author, "The Pocket Paper Engineer: How to Make Pop-Ups Step by Step"): Oh, thank you. </p>
    <p>SIMON: I have the elements for a prototype, a couple of pictures, right, that I downloaded off your site. And they're of the - tell us about - because it's a picture of the Obama family standing there with Chief Justice Roberts. And of course, this hasn't happened. It's not an actual picture. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: No, no. So, this was one of the challenges I had. </p>
    <p>SIMON: I'm going to cut as you speak, OK... </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: OK. The challenge was coming up with a scene that hadn't taken place yet. So in order to do that, I asked a number of neighbors and friends to pose in their steads, and we substituted the faces of the Obamas and Chief Justice Roberts. </p>
    <p>SIMON: There we go. OK. I've cut it out. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: OK. </p>
    <p>SIMON: And now what do I do? </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Well, then you take the bone folder, which is a special... </p>
    <p>SIMON: You gave me something called a bone folder. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Yes, yes. </p>
    <p>SIMON: And now, is this made of actual bone? </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: It's made of cow bone. </p>
    <p>SIMON: This is something you might've used to like assassinate the Neanderthal man. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Oh, no, no. It's not that sharp. </p>
    <p>SIMON: OK. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: So, you take that bone folder,  and you run it along the dashed green lines there. </p>
    <p>SIMON: OK. I've got it. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: OK. Then you have the Capitol grounds and a background sky, and you will tape the grounds and the sky card together. </p>
    <p>SIMON: All right. And then - so I fold the old bone folder again. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Yes. </p>
    <p>SIMON: Does this seem right? </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Yes. </p>
    <p>SIMON: OK. What do I do? </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Now, what you're going to do is tape together the sky, there, and then you're going to attach the Capitol grounds to that. </p>
    <p>SIMON: Like that, right? </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: OK. And then you're going to do the same with the Obamas. You're going to put glue on the bottom of their tab, and position them right up against the front of the Capitol. And there you have it. </p>
    <p>SIMON: Oh, my word. So, we've got a picture of the Obama family as President Obama receives - being sworn in. Now, I am told that in the original picture that you guys contrived, there were also people impersonating Senator Biden and his family. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Yes. I had originally put the Bidens in. But going back through the pictures of past inaugurations, the editors of the Post noticed that the vice presidential party usually wasn't standing right with the president as he was being sworn in. So, my apologies to the Bidens, but they are not in the pop-up picture anymore. </p>
    <p>SIMON: They didn't make the pop-up. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: They're sitting in the background with the dignitaries. </p>
    <p>SIMON: Well, thank you very much. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARTON: Oh, thank you. </p>
    <p>SIMON: You can download Carol Barton's inauguration pop-up Tuesday from the Washington Post Web site. This is NPR News. </p>
