<h1> "Got An Inauguration Day Ticket? Tell Us!" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>Since we put out the word that we're trying to find people who will attend the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama, we've received lots of responses, but we want more. So if you managed to snag one of the 250,000 golden tickets to the ceremony, let Weekend Edition know how did you get tickets? Who's going with you? Who isn't? How are you getting to Washington? </p>
    <p>Join the multimedia fun, and tell us everything. We accept video logs, blog posts, tweets, and email. To find out more, go to npr.org/soapbox. </p>
    <p>You're listening to Weekend Edition from NPR News. </p>
