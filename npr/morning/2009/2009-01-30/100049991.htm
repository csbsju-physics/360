<h1> "Mississippi Wants To Unload Jet On eBay" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. In these hard times, many states are reduced to selling government property, like desks and police cruisers. Mississippi plans to sell a jet. Valued at $3.7 million, it's been used to fly Governor Haley Barbour around. If the state senate approves, Mississippi will offer the jet on eBay. That's something Alaska's governor, Sarah Palin, famously did. Mostly lost in that story: The Alaska state jet didn't sell on eBay. It's Morning Edition. </p>
