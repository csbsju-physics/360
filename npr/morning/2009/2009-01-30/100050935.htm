    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. A kindergartner in Nevada celebrating his birthday got cupcakes in class - and an unusually big present. When young Gabriel put down his cupcake long enough to unwrap that huge box, out popped his dad, back from Iraq. Army mechanic Casey Hurles is home for two weeks of playtime. Gabriel understands his dad will leave soon. The Associated Press quotes the child as saying, he works in the war. It's Morning Edition. </p>
