<h1> "Spirit Airlines Urged To Stop Sexy Ad Campaign" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business today is dispirited. You've heard the marketing adage, sex sells. Well, flight attendants at Spirit Airlines don't want to use sex to sell their services. They've complained to the company about its series of sexually suggestive ads. One invites customers to enjoy its DDs, which the airlines says stands for deep discounts, though it could be read as a bra size. The head of the flight attendants' union says she feels as though she's reliving the battles that women fought 40 years ago. An airline spokeswoman said the ads have been out for a year with no complaints. </p>
