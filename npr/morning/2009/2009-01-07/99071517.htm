    <p>SHAPIRO: The car industry is shrinking, housing is in a slump, and that means aluminum makers are in trouble. The lightweight metal is not just used for foil, it's also in cars and home appliances. The world's largest aluminum maker is Alcoa, and now that company says it's getting rid of more than 15,000 jobs. That's about 15 percent of its workforce. Alcoa's global rivals are also cutting costs. The entire industry is being hit by falling demand and falling aluminum prices. </p>
