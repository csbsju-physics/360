<h1> "Bare Facts: Ski Bum Left Hanging On Vail Chairlift" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Ari Shapiro. No ski bum jokes or full moon jokes, just the facts, the bare facts. A vacationer somehow fell through the chair of his ski lift in Vail, Colorado. His pants got caught. And in a feat worthy of Cirque du Soleil, he ended up hanging upside down, naked. He was not injured, and he didn't have to hang there too long, just seven minutes - long enough for other skiers to snap photographs, which, of course, are now online. It's Morning Edition. </p>
