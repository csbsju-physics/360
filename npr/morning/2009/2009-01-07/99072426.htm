<h1> "No Football Timeout For Congress" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. A Florida congressman missed a chance to delay certifying the election of Barack Obama. Cliff Stearns mainly objected to the timing. The House certifies that election tomorrow, which is the same day as the national championship football game between Florida and Oklahoma. The congressman would rather attend the game with his home-state team instead of staying in Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined his request to reschedule House business. It's Morning Edition. </p>
