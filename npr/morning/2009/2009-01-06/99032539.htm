<h1> "Homeland Security Gets The Reality TV Treatment" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Agencies like the CIA are supposed to work mainly overseas. But in recent years, they've been urged to work more closely with domestic security agencies like the Department of Homeland Security, which we'll hear about next. That much criticized agency gets a burst of publicity starting tonight. ABC begins a reality show called "Homeland Security U.S.A." It has the look of a documentary. It avoids politics, and is paced more like a police drama. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports.</p>
    <p>CARRIE KAHN: (Soundbite from "Homeland Security U.S.A.")</p>
    <p>U: The United States, with entry points at hundreds of airports, harbors and along a border of more than 100,000 miles, is protected by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
    <p>KAHN: (Soundbite from "Homeland Security U.S.A.")</p>
    <p>U: This is "Homeland Security U.S.A."</p>
    <p>KAHN: (Soundbite from "Homeland Security U.S.A.")</p>
    <p>U: Please make the notifications up the chain of command that we have a possible 40 kilos of cocaine, and we're going to continue to search the rest of the car.</p>
    <p>KAHN: (Soundbite from "Homeland Security U.S.A.")</p>
    <p>U: When I have to go?</p>
    <p>U: Tonight, you will be transported to another facility, spend the night.</p>
    <p>U: But I don't accept this decision.</p>
    <p>KAHN: (Soundbite from "Homeland Security U.S.A.")</p>
    <p>M: Hi, what are you bringing from Mexico?</p>
    <p>U: Nothing.</p>
    <p>M: What was the purpose of your trip to Mexico?</p>
    <p>KAHN: Brown landed a starring role in the premiere episode, and much teasing from colleagues.</p>
    <p>M: I get called names like Hollywood, and, you know, they keep asking for autographs. But I won't sign an autograph for under five bucks, so...</p>
    <p>KAHN: (Soundbite from "Homeland Security U.S.A.")</p>
    <p>M: (Spanish spoken) Open the door!</p>
    <p>U: No.</p>
    <p>M: Code three! Code three!</p>
    <p>KAHN: Agent James Carraway was one of the officers in that scene. He says unfortunately, it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.</p>
    <p>M: Sometimes those things does happen. It's unfortunate, but they do happen.</p>
    <p>KAHN: Were you upset that that made it into the show?</p>
    <p>M: Not really, because, you know, one thing I believe in is not trying to portray a false sense of what we do.</p>
    <p>KAHN: Department of Homeland Security spokesman Ed Fox says the agency has no editorial control over the show, but it did suggest changes when an agent's safety was compromised, or if enforcement strategies were revealed. He says the show doesn't deal with policy or politics, just the hard work of keeping the country safe.</p>
    <p>M: And sometimes that's lost in the rather heated debates of Washington over the high-profile, sensitive issues that we deal with at this level.</p>
    <p>KAHN: But some immigrant advocates and other critics say you can't separate the workers from the work, and charge that the show is propaganda. A few have planned to hold protests in front of ABC affiliates tonight. That may be the least of worries for "Homeland Security USA." Starting next week, it will compete in the 8 o'clock time slot with Fox's "American Idol." Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Los Angeles.</p>
