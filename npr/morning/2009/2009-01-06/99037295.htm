<h1> "Anheuser-Busch Stops Free Beer Samples" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. We don't know what they were thinking, but the Anheuser-Busch brewing company says it will stop giving out free samples. Makers of Budweiser also run theme parks like Busch Gardens and Sea World. If you'd dropped by a park, you could get free beer. Now they're trying to make the parks more kid-friendly, which means some of the parks get more restaurants, and also, no free alcohol. The company says the samples had a narrow appeal. It's Morning Edition.</p>
