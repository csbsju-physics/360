<h1> "Restaurant Staff Works 1 Day Without Pay" </h1>
    <p>LINDA WERTHEIMER, Host: </p>
    <p>Our last word in business today is recession solidarity. Like many restaurants, Mr. B's Pancake House in Muskegon, Michigan, is struggling with fewer customers. Last week, one of the cooks suggested everyone work a day for free. So on a recent Sunday, 17 employees, about half the staff, worked without pay. They saved the restaurant $700 in wages, and the deed did not go unrewarded. Patrons found out what was going on and left $800 in tips. That's the business news on Morning Edition from NPR News.
