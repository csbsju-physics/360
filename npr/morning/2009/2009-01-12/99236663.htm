<h1> "Staff Sgt. Plays Obama In Inaugural Rehearsal" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Tourists near the U.S. Capitol yesterday could be forgiven for double-checking the date. Barack Obama raised his right hand for the inauguration. It was a rehearsal. The incoming president was played by a stand-in named Derrick Brooks. He's a U.S. Army staff sergeant, 26 years old. He was chosen for his resemblance to Mr. Obama, though it's not perfect. Sergeant Brooks met the real Barack Obama, who said Brooks' ears were smaller than his. It's Morning Edition.</p>
