<h1> "Joe The Plumber Reports On Hamas Rocket Fire" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Joe the Plumber is now Joe the War Correspondent. Samuel Wurzelbacher became famous after he questioned Barack Obama during the campaign. Then he was repeatedly invoked in a presidential debate. Now, he's working for a conservative website, and he's in Israel reporting on Hamas rocket fire. Joe the War Correspondent has not claimed deep background in Middle East affairs. He does say he is, quote, "an expert on media bias." It's Morning Edition.</p>
