<h1> "Madoff Victims Sell Memorabilia On eBay" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Clients of Bernard Madoff may have lost their money, but they did come away with souvenirs. Now, clients and former employees are selling items with the company's name. They came away with swag from the guy accused of the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, and they're using the auction site eBay to sell things like T-shirts, beach towels, umbrellas, coolers, binoculars, flashlights and tote bags. The postings tell buyers they can own a piece of history. </p>
