<h1> "New York's Rainbow Room Closing Restaurant" </h1>

    <p>And our last word in business today is the end of the Rainbow. The Rainbow Grill restaurant, part of the famed Rainbow Room, is temporarily closing. The Rainbow Room opened in 1934. It's become an icon of glitz, glamour, and dinner dancing. The landmark upscale party venue overlooks the skating rink in Rockefeller Center. It offers stunning views of the city and $50 steaks - $53 rib eyes to be exact. They don't seem to be selling well these days.  </p>
    <p>The recession and a dispute over the lease have forced the owners to close down the Rainbow Grill. A spokesman says it's unclear when it will reopen. But don't put away your dancing shoes just yet. Weekend dinner dancing, as well as the bar and banquet space, will remain open. And that's the business news on Morning Edition from NPR News.
