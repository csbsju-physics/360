<h1> "Urkaine Still Without Gas Shipments From Russia" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host:  </p>
    <p>NPR's business news starts with that Russian gas dispute. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Russia still is not sending any natural gas to its neighbor Ukraine, and European leaders are now holding emergency talks about this. Russia and Ukraine cannot agree on gas prices, and that appears to be disrupting supplies to Europe. Europe depends on a lot of Russian gas, most of which travels through Ukraine on its way to those other European countries. And last week Russia cut off the supply to Ukraine.  </p>
    <p>Now Russia is accusing Ukraine of stealing gas intended for other European countries, a charge the Ukraine denies. Several European countries, though, are reporting reduced gas supplies. And this whole incident is provoking memories from three years ago. That's when Russia cut off gas supplies for a day and prompted accusations that Moscow was using its energy supplies as a political weapon. </p>
