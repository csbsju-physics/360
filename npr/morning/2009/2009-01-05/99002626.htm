<h1> "Obama Family, Welcome To Washington" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>President-elect Obama has arrived in Washington. He touched down in a Boeing 757 decorated with the presidential seal. It's a military aircraft often used by vice presidents and first ladies. Air Force 1, of course, is still taken, as is the house that Obama and his family plan to call home for the next four years. So for now, the Obamas plan to stay in Washington Hay-Adams Hotel. The family came to Washington before the inauguration so the couple's two girls could start school. The president-elect says after a couple of years of traveling during the campaign, he is not looking forward to another two weeks in a hotel, but the Hay-Adams does have some of the best views in the city. Including a view of the White House, which is visible just across a park. </p>
