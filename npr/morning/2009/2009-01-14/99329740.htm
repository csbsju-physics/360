<h1> "California Girl Is Text Messaging Fiend" </h1>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. Thirteen-year-old California girl Reina Hardesty uses her new cell phone a lot. In one month, she managed to rack up more than 14,528 text messages. That's about an average of 470 texts a day, or a message nearly every 2 minutes she was awake. Luckily for her parents, Rita's phone plan includes unlimited texting. Still, her dad wasn't pleased. New rule, no texting after dinner. It's Morning Edition. </p>
