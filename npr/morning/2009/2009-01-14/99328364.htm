    <p>INSKEEP: One company that could soon shrink is Chrysler. After receiving billions in government bailout money, the automaker is under extra pressure to restructure. Now the Reuters news agency reports that Chrysler may sell, quote, "key assets" to a French-Japanese carmaker, Renault-Nissan. Renault-Nissan denies any talks, though it has spoken to Chrysler in the past, and the two companies have plans to produce cars together. Reuters also reports that Chrysler may sell some of itself to a Canadian auto parts supplier.</p>
