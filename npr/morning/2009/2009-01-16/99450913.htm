<h1> "Schoolyard Dare Results In Stuck Tongue" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. It was a schoolyard dare immortalized in the movie "A Christmas Story:" lick a metal pole in cold weather. And in the town that movie was based on Hammond. Indiana, a 10-year-old boy was dared - maybe even triple dog dared - to do just that. Temperatures were at 10 degrees, and guess what? The boy got stuck. An ambulance arrived, but by then, the boy was able to, ah, unstick his tongue. It's Morning Edition. </p>
