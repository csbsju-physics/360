<h1> "Same Lottery Numbers Drawn 2 Nights In A Row" </h1>

    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. I'll let you Google the odds. On Monday night, the winning numbers for Nebraska's lottery were 1, 9 and 6. The next night, the winning numbers were 1, 9 and 6 - the same three numbers in the same sequence. A lottery spokesman said two separate computers randomly generated the same numbers. Each night did produce entirely different winners. The top prize, by the way, was $600. It's Morning Edition. </p>
