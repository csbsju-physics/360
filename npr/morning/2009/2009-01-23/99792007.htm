<h1> "Worst Hollywood Films Nominated For Razzies" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE; host:  </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. "Slumdog Millionaire" snagged 10 Oscar nominations yesterday, and another Indian-themed picture, "The Love Guru," picked up seven nominations - for the Razzies. The Razzy Awards, of course, are given each year to the worst Hollywood has to offer. "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is up for worst prequel, remake, rip-off or sequel. Golden Raspberries could also go to Eddie Murphy for "Meet Dave," and Kate Hudson for "Fool's Gold."  It's Morning Edition. </p>
