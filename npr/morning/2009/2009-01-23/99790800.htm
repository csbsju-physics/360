    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business today is "instant revival." Polaroid announced last year it would cease production of its instant film. Some people just couldn't bear the idea of never again seeing images magically appear on that iconic white-bordered paper. The imminent death of Polaroid film sparked a global campaign to keep it alive. Now, an Austrian entrepreneur plans to start manufacturing the film at a factory in Holland. Florian Kaps has an established passion for Polaroid. He has a Web site dedicated to Polaroid photography and an art gallery in Vienna dedicated to Polaroid art. He says this project is more than a business plan; quote, "it's a fight against the idea that everything has to die when it doesn't create turnover." And that's the business news on Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
