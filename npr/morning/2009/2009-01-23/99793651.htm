<h1> "Quartet's Inauguration Music Was Recorded" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. Chief Justice John Roberts may have flubbed the oath he administered to President Obama, but the quartet that played at the inauguration was note perfect, despite freezing temperatures that would have sent their instruments wildly out of tune. And that's because the world heard a recording. The quartet, with cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Itzhak Perlman, did play at the inauguration, but only those nearest the stage heard them. It's Morning Edition. </p>
