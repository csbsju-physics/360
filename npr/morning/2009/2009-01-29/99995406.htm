    <p>MONTAGNE: As of this morning, the deadline for the big switch to digital TV is still February 17th. That means you have less than three weeks to get ready. Democrats in the Senate have been trying to postpone the date until June. They fear millions of Americans, especially the elderly and low-income viewers, aren't prepared for the transition and will be left without a way to watch TV.  </p>
    <p>President Obama supported the idea, but yesterday House Republicans swatted it down. They said a delay would confuse customers and that it would be costly to companies to have to keep broadcasting in analogue for another four months.  </p>
