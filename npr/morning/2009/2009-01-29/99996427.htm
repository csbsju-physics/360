<h1> "Bart Simpson's Voice Promotes Scientology" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. Bart Simpson is known for prank phone calls, but he now seems to be answering to a higher power. Nancy Cartwright, the actress who does Bart's voice, has recorded a robocall - partly in character - advertising an event hosted by the Church of Scientology. For now, the FOX Network isn't having a cow, but "The Simpsons" producer told the Hollywood Reporter that the show doesn't endorse any belief system "more profound than Butterfinger bars." It's Morning Edition. </p>
