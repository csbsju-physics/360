<h1> "NBC Rejects PETA's 'Steamy' Super Bowl Ad" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business today is sex sells vegetables - or so the nonprofit organization PETA was hoping. The group, which stands for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, wanted to broadcast its message during the Super Bowl.  </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of PETA ad) </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: So it came up with this ad that you're hearing that used tried and true formulas. Its steamy 30-second spot features scantily clad women holding broccoli, pumpkins, and asparagus in provocative poses. It claims vegetarians have better sex. NBC rejected the sexually explicit ad, and, naturally, that ad is now getting free play on the Internet. And perhaps that was the idea all along. That's the business news on Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
