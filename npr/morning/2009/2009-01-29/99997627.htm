<h1> "Bolo Alert: Dress Code Change Sought For Tie" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. New Mexico's state bird is the roadrunner, and its official state neckwear is the bolo. That means a string tie ought to get a man into any place that demands a tie. Except, it turns out, the floor of the state legislature. A New Mexico state representative has now introduced a resolution to allow lawmakers to sport bolo ties. He's tried before, no luck, but perhaps this year's message of change will extend to the sartorial. It's Morning Edition. </p>
