    <p>Our last word in Business is million dollar gamble. In Biloxi, Mississippi, a woman was playing slots at a local casino, and she hit the jackpot. The display on the machine showed she'd won $1 million, but a sign on the machine said the maximum payout was $8,000. The casino naturally wanted to pay out that lower amount, even though state gaming officials deemed the woman should get the million. But a state judge ruled in favor of the casino. The feisty gambler is not giving up. She's now placing her bets on Mississippi's Supreme Court. She's taking her case there to see if she can get her million-dollar payout.  </p>
