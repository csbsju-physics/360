    <p>MONTAGNE: As President-elect Barack Obama shepherds his economic stimulus package through Congress, there's a lot of talk about job creation. Many employers are more focused on eliminating jobs. In some of the latest cuts, Delta Airlines said it expects to lose about 2,000 workers this month through early retirement programs. Motorola, which make mobile phones, yesterday said it will lay off 4,000 workers this year. That's on top of 3,000 job cuts Motorola announced a few months ago.  </p>
