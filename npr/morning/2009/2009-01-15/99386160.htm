<h1> "Congress Proposes 'Cash For Clunkers' Program" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. The government has given billions to automakers, who need to sell more cars. Congress may soon offer you a few thousand bucks to buy a new one. The proposed bill is called Cash for Clunkers. The idea is to get millions of aging gas-guzzlers off the road and replace them with fuel-efficient cars. If the program is approved and if you want to save fuel, you could get a voucher for up to $4500 to make the trade-in. It's Morning Edition. </p>
