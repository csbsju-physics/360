<h1> "Super Bowl Still Attracts Ad Buyers" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Economists worry about deflation, falling prices, but at least the price for Super Bowl ads keeps going up. Some troubled companies are staying away. Don't expect to see a lot of ads for General Motors. But NBC says most Super Bowl ads are sold. And if you're watching the big game, you should feel flattered. Thirty-second ads are going for $3 million. That means somebody paid $100,000 per second to talk to you. It's Morning Edition. </p>
