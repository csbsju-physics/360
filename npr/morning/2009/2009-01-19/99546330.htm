<h1> "Cosby, Poussaint On Merits Of Two Parents" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. An acclaimed artist from India was invited to inaugurate an exhibition of his work. S.H. Raza's work is so popular that it sometimes sells for millions of dollars. He turned up at a gallery in New Delhi, and he paused to admire some of his paintings on the walls - which is how the artist discovered that most of the paintings on exhibit were fakes. Somebody forged his abstract paintings to get a payoff that was not abstract at all. It's Morning Edition.</p>
