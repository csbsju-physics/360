    <p>Good morning, I'm Linda Wertheimer. Susan McCullen saw a good thing at a Goodwill warehouse in Tennessee. She was sorting items for sale when she spotted a gold frame, and found a vivid watercolor of the Bay of Naples, with a letter from the artist, Ellsworth Woodward, who sold it in San Francisco for $75 dollars around 1915. It brought 8,000-plus this week in the Goodwill online auction. It's Morning Edition. </p>
