<h1> "'Lipstick Index' Glosses Over Spotty Data" </h1>

    <p>The theory that lipstick sales go up in a recession does have its believers. But our last word in business today is gloss-over. There may be some evidence that low consumer confidence sparks a rise in sales of this relatively affordable luxury, but "The Economist" magazine takes a swipe at that notion. A recent article says historical data is spotty. The theory may also be wishful thinking. The term lipstick index was coined by an executive at the cosmetics company Estee Lauder. That's the business news on Morning Edition, from NPR News. I'm Linda Wertheimer. </p>
