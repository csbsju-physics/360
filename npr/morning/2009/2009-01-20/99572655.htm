<h1> "Super-Celebrities Unite For Day Of Service" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. Yesterday, Superman, Spider-Man, Usher and Oprah all came together. Yes, they answered Barack Obama's call for service. Instead of a day off, Mr. Obama called for a day on. So Usher and Superman - that would be actor Brandon Routh - and Spider-Man - Tobey Maguire - helped build shelves in the library at Simon Elementary School in southeast Washington, D.C. Oprah - her crew documented the whole thing. It's Morning Edition. </p>
