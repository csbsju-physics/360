<h1> "Sausages Get Obama Bump At Landmark D.C. Diner" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host:  </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. People are waiting hours for hot dogs in Washington, D.C. President-elect Obama stopped at Ben's Chili Bowl the other day. That local landmark serves Washington's best-known indigenous food, half-smoked sausages. Ever since, the line at Ben's has gone out the door. There may also be a line at a restaurant in Hawaii. It'll be early morning there when the Hawaii native takes the oath, and Don Ho's restaurant is offering a special inaugural breakfast. It's Morning Edition. </p>
