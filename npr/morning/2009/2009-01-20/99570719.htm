    <p>MONTAGNE: Chrysler is still struggling to find a path to survival. One road may lead to Italy. Chrysler is in talks with Italian carmaker Fiat about a possible alliance. Neither company has announced details, but industry publications and news reports say that Fiat could take a stake in Chrysler. The deal could involve Fiat's retooling Chrysler factories and helping Chrysler produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. Fiat could also sell cars in the U.S. through Chrysler. </p>
