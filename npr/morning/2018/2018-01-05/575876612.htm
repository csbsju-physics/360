<h1> "University Lists Words That Deserve Wider Use" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep with a chance to expand your vocabulary. Wayne State University is promoting expressive words that could be used more. For example, there's couth.</p>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>OK, I've heard of uncouth, but...</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Well, couth is the opposite - cultured, well-mannered. Frangible means fragile. Nugatory is worthless.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Yep.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And then there's eucatastrophe.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Eucatastrophe?</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Yeah. Catastrophe is where the story goes wrong. Eucatastrophe is where everything turns out all right. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
