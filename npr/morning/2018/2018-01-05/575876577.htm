    <p>Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin. How does that old song go, I'm just a fool whose intentions are good? Authorities say a man robbed a bank in Ohio and used most of the money to buy an engagement ring. Police say 36-year-old Dustin Pedersen spent $4,500 on a ring less than an hour after the robbery and gave it to his fiancee the next day. Pedersen denies the robbery but admitted the surveillance photos sure look like him. I guess he was in a hurry to lock in that for-better-or-for-worse thing. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
