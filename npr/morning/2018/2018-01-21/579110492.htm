<h1> "Sunday Puzzle: It Takes Two" </h1>
    <p>LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>And it's time to play The Puzzle.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Joining me, as always, is Will Shortz. He's puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzle master.</p>
    <p>Will, Good morning.</p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: How was Hollywood?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: It's a - I had an interesting event last week. It was a Television Critics Association gala for the Hallmark channels. And I'm advising on a crossword mystery for them. There were lots of famous people there.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Really? Who is the best one?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Best one - I don't know. I've met Jon Voight, shook his hand. Unfortunately, he doesn't do crosswords. So...</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Did you ask him?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: I did. I did.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter) That's a good icebreaker. All right. Remind us of last week's challenge.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes, I said name a world capital. I said it's an older way of spelling the name. Drop three letters, and the remaining letters in order will name another world capital. And I said both cities have more than a million residents. Well, the answer is Djakarta. That's spelled the old way starting with a silent D. D-J-A-K-A-R-T-A. And you drop three letters. You get Dakar, the capital of Senegal.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: This one was pretty challenging. We only got about 300 correct responses, and our randomly selected winner is Dan Streit of Port St. Lucie, Fla. Congratulations.</p>
    <p>DAN STREIT: Thank you very much.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me a little bit about yourself. I heard that you were an elementary school teacher.</p>
    <p>STREIT: I was for 38 years.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow.</p>
    <p>STREIT: And I retired a few years ago.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how long have you been doing puzzles?</p>
    <p>STREIT: Forever.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter) Forever.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: (Laughter) Good answer.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Since I was a little kid and throughout my teaching career, the students were very puzzling. And I get involved in any puzzles I can find.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Dan, are you ready to play the puzzle?</p>
    <p>STREIT: Definitely.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Let's take it away.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right. Dan, I'm going to give you some four-letter words. For each one, add one letter in front and one letter in back to complete a familiar six-letter word.</p>
    <p>STREIT: OK.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: No proper names. Also, no just adding an S or D at the end of a five-letter word to get the six-letter one. For example, if I said lane - L-A-N-E - you would say planet, putting a P at the front and a T at the end.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Got it.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Number one is moot - M-O-O-T.</p>
    <p>STREIT: That would be smooth.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Smooth is right. Number two is hang - H-A-N-G.</p>
    <p>STREIT: That would be change.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Uh-huh. Went - W-E-N-T.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Went would be twenty.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. Nigh - N-I-G-H.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Nigh would be knight.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Knight, yes. Starting with a silent K, right. Tree - T-R-E-E.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Street.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Uh-huh. Refi - R-E-F-I.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Let's see - prefix.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Uh-huh. Brad - B-R-A-D.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Abrade.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Uh-huh. Awes - A-W-E-S.</p>
    <p>STREIT: A-W-E-S. Let's see.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: There's a common suffix involved on this one.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Yeah, I'm thinking E-S-T.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Rawest.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Rawest. Yeah, that's the...</p>
    <p>STREIT: Oh, OK. That's a hard one to say.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: ...Rawest weather we've had. Yeah. Onto - O-N-T-O.</p>
    <p>STREIT: O-N-T-O. Let's see.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Ever eat at Chinese restaurants?</p>
    <p>STREIT: Wonton.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: There you go. Craw - C-R-A-W.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Scrawl.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Uh-huh. Isle - I-S-L-E.</p>
    <p>STREIT: I-S-L-E. Let's see - misled.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Misled. Good. Rest - R-E-S-T.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Rest could be - let's see. P - can I put a Y on the end? Presty.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: It's not presty, no.</p>
    <p>STREIT: No.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: You got the right first letter, though.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Crest.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Oh, no. Not a C.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Oh, OK. That was what I was thinking.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Sorry. I thought you had a different letter at the start.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Oh, what did you think I had?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: I thought you said a P, actually.</p>
    <p>STREIT: A P. Yeah, I think - that's what I really said. "Prest-O Change-O."</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Presto is it. Here's a tough one. Plan - P-L-A-N.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Plan. Upland.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Upland. Good. And here's your last one. Afar - A-F-A-R.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Safari.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Safari. Dan, you're a pro.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: You are a pro. You were amazing. You have clearly been doing this for a long time.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Thank you.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: How do you feel?</p>
    <p>STREIT: I feel good. That was fun.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter).</p>
    <p>STREIT: I always love any subtle challenge you got. I'd love to try it.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. Well, you did great. For playing our puzzle today, you'll get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin as well as puzzle books and games. You can read all about it at npr.org/puzzle. Dan, what member station do you listen to?</p>
    <p>STREIT: I listen to WQCS - Fort Pierce, Port St. Lucie, Fla.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's great. Dan Streit of Port St. Lucie, Fla., thanks for playing The Puzzle.</p>
    <p>STREIT: Thank you, Lulu. Thank you, Will.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Thanks.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Will, what's next week's challenge?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes, it comes from listener Tom Arnold (ph) of Eugene, Ore. Take the name of a conveyance in seven letters. Drop the middle letter. And the remaining letters can be rearranged to name the place where such a conveyance is often used. What is it? So, again, name of a conveyance in seven letters. Drop the middle letter.
