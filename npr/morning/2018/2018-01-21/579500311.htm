<h1> "Supporters Assess Trump's First Year" </h1>
    <p>LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>It's been one year since President Trump's inauguration. We wanted to get a progress report from his supporters. So we called some up and caught some others at the rally known as the March for Life this past week in Washington - first, what they liked.</p>
    <p>STEPHEN ROWE: The biggest things I'm happy about are a lot of pro-life legislation that's moving forward.</p>
    <p>RON SCHAFER: I'm pleased with all the things that he's accomplished in rolling back regulations.</p>
    <p>BRENDA DAWKINS: I love his immigration policy. I love his tax reformation.</p>
    <p>DON REID: I'd give him an A. He has been able to withstand the onslaught of a media that hates him, members of his home party who want to get rid of him and radicals on the left who are determined to impeach him.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: And now what they think the president can do better.</p>
    <p>JUDY KIMILARY: I'd like him to stay off Twitter a little bit more.</p>
    <p>JOHN LOCKHART: Get off of Twitter a little more often.</p>
    <p>DAWKINS: I'm not real happy with his tweeting out everything that he's thinking. But that's his way, it seems.</p>
    <p>CHRIS BRAZIL: Really, I haven't had much problem with really anything he's done.</p>
    <p>MICHAEL DRISKELL: He's just doing everything he promised to do. And we are making America great again.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Ron Schafer, Brenda Dawkins, Stephen Rowe, Don Reid, Judy Kimilary, John Lockhart, Chris Brazil and Michael Driskell, all supporters of President Trump assessing his first year in office.</p>
