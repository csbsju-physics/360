<h1> "Oregonians Adapt To Pumping Their Own Gas" </h1>
    <p>LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>In Oregon, the new year brings a new ability for gas stations in some parts of the state to offer self-service. That's something that's been mostly banned there since 1951. And it leaves New Jersey as the only state with a complete ban on pump-it-yourself gas. Chris Lehman reports.</p>
    <p>CHRIS LEHMAN, BYLINE: Here at The Heights Fuel Stop in Hood River, there are new signs telling drivers they can get out of their cars and pump their own gas if they want.</p>
    <p>MARK AZURE: Thank you so much. You have a good day.</p>
    <p>LEHMAN: But station attendant Mark Azure says most people aren't taking up the offer.</p>
    <p>AZURE: About 85 percent of the people still want their gas pumped.</p>
    <p>LEHMAN: For Mary Brenneman, the self-serve option was a surprise. She gave it a try, but...</p>
    <p>MARY BRENNEMAN: To be perfectly honest, I'm not thrilled about it. You know, it's cold. I'd rather have somebody else pump my gas, and I'm not ashamed to say that.</p>
    <p>LEHMAN: A new law took effect January 1. It only allows self-serve in rural counties defined as those with a population of less than 40,000 people. That's about half the state. But it means people in Portland or drivers on the heavily-traveled Interstate 5 freeway won't see any change.</p>
    <p>When Oregon and New Jersey lawmakers banned self-serve some 70 years ago, they cited safety. Gasoline is flammable after all. But when the new Oregon law to ease the self-serve ban passed, safety was also a concern. It turns out gas stations in smaller communities have a hard time employing attendants 24 hours a day, leaving people there with no way to fuel up in an emergency. Supporters say allowing self-serve means fewer stranded travelers. For lifelong Oregonians, it marks a significant change to what they're used to.</p>
    <p>Mattie Back says filling her own tank was a learning experience.</p>
    <p>MATTIE BACK: So I pulled up to the thing. And I was ready to hand him my card and tell him how much I needed. And he was like, yeah, so it's self-serve. And I was like, what does that mean? (Laughter) I did not know how to do it. He was like, my job is to teach you how to do it. And I was really awkward about it. But, I mean, it's not hard to learn. It was just really weird.</p>
    <p>LEHMAN: Not all Oregonians find the idea of pumping their own gas a novelty. Jeff Pulk moved to Hood River from Michigan four years ago.</p>
    <p>JEFF PULK: It's one of those things that if somebody wants to pump their own gas, they should be able to pump their own gas.</p>
    <p>LEHMAN: Pulk says he read with amusement some national news stories mocking Oregonians who seemed scared at the idea of having to fill up their tanks themselves.</p>
    <p>PULK: And I had a bunch of buddies text me also, you know - ha, ha, ha (ph). You get to pump your own gas now. How're you going to, you know, get by and stuff like that.</p>
    <p>LEHMAN: Pulk says his response - he's saving up for an electric car so he won't have to worry about it much longer. For NPR News, I'm Chris Lehman.</p>
