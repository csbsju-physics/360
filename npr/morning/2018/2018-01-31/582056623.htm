<h1> "Swiss University To Offer Degree In Yodeling" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin. Admit it. Yodeling is awesome.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Yodeling).</p>
    <p>MARTIN: If you've ever wanted to learn, now's your chance. A Swiss university has announced it's going to start teaching the Alpine singing style. The classes will be led by a prize-winning Swiss yodeler. They're offering both bachelor's and master's degrees. The university is limiting the program to just three or four students, so they still have to decide yodel-ay-hee-who (ph) will be accepted. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
