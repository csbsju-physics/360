<h1> "Giant Block Of Ice Falls On Pennsylvania Man" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep with another tale of winter weather safety. We told you of the man who set a fire when he warmed up frozen pipes with a blowtorch. In Erie, Pa., a man removed in giant chunk of ice from the side of his house - 6 by 10 feet. He chipped it off, and it fell on him. Most of the weight was borne by a woodpile. The Erie Times-News reports the man suffered only minor injuries, and the fire chief calls him the luckiest man on earth. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
