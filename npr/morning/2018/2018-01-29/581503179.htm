    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. A Rhode Island lawmaker wants to eliminate outdated laws. John Edwards says the laws built up over centuries. It's illegal to test the speed of your horse on a public road. A driving law from 1916 says you must make an audible signal honking or shouting if you pass someone.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: On your left.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Whoa.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Dueling is still banned in Rhode Island. And it's illegal to interfere with Navy torpedo practice, which, come to think of it, sounds like a good idea. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
