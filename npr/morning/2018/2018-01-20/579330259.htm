<h1> "National Politics Plays A Role In South Carolina Election" </h1>
    <p>VICTORIA HANSEN, BYLINE: And I'm Victoria Hansen in Charleston, S.C., where there was another election this Tuesday and national politics played a role. Forty-year-old Nancy Mace is now a state House representative and the first woman to lead her district. But firsts for her are nothing new. She was also the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, a once all-male military school.</p>
    <p>NANCY MACE: I think people are sick and tired of politicians. I know I certainly am.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: The commercial real estate agent is not new to politics. She took a swing at Senator Lindsey Graham's seat in 2014 and worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.</p>
    <p>MACE: People are really angry in this country. Whether you're on the Republican side or the Democrat side, we're all passionate and angry about the same issues but for different reasons.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: A year after Trump's election and during her own race, Mace found people still anxious for change. Her Facebook campaign featured a picture with the president, but did that photo op win her any votes?</p>
    <p>MACE: I'm sure that it did in some part, that connection there, but I also ran on my own ideas, and I worked really hard.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Much of Mace's district is affluent, like her community on Daniel Island, adorned with egret-laced tidal creeks and marshes.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF EGRET CALLS)</p>
    <p>HANSEN: That's where Bob Houghton scouts for dolphins. He voted for Mace and Trump.</p>
    <p>BOB HOUGHTON: I don't necessarily approve of his ways, but I certainly was anti the person he ran against.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Nancy Benjamin is out for a walk and out of patience with Trump.</p>
    <p>NANCY BENJAMIN: It's just a gridlock because he flip-flops all the time.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Tim Touchberry combs the beach, bucket in hand, for bottles and sharks' teeth. The low country native voted for Trump, hoping he'd shake up Washington. He's still hopeful.</p>
    <p>TIM TOUCHBERRY: I still have to give him a fair mark but not a real high mark. He gets after it. And I’m not sure it’s always in the ways that everybody feels like he should.</p>
