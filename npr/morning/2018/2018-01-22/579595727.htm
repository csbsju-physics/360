<h1> "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Reflects On The #MeToo Movement: 'It's About Time' " </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>The Sundance Film Festival has in some ways become a forum for more than film. This year, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was there promoting a documentary that she's appearing in. But when she spoke to NPR's Nina Totenberg on a stage at Sundance, the conversation broadened.</p>
    <p>NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The occasion for Ginsburg being here is the premiere of a CNN documentary film about her life and her role as a young lawyer who became the architect of the legal fight for women's rights. The phrase sexual harassment was unknown in those days, so I asked Ginsburg if she had ever experienced inappropriate sexual conduct. Oh, yes, she answered, lots of times.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>RUTH BADER GINSBURG: The attitude to sexual harassment was simply get past it. Boys will be boys.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: As a personal example, she cited her experience with a chemistry professor when she was an undergraduate student at Cornell and was worried about what she called her abilities as a chemistry student. And her professor offered to give her a practice exam.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>GINSBURG: So he gave me a practice exam. The next day on the test, the test is the practice exam, and I knew exactly what he wanted in return.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: What did you do about the professor? Did you just stay clear of him? What did you do?</p>
    <p>GINSBURG: I went to his office, and I said, how dare you? How dare you do this?</p>
    <p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>GINSBURG: And that was the end of that.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: I assume you did quite well on that exam.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>GINSBURG: And I deliberately made two mistakes.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: I ask Ginsburg what her thoughts are about the #MeToo movement.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>GINSBURG: Well, I think it's about time. And...</p>
    <p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>GINSBURG: ...For so long, women were silent, thinking there was nothing you could do about it. But now, the law is on the side of women or men who encounter harassment.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: And does she worry about a backlash?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>GINSBURG: When I see women appearing every place in numbers, I'm less worried about backlash than I might have been 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
