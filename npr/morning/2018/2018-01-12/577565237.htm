    <p>Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin. This week, some of the world's top tech entrepreneurs gathered for the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas. These people tackle really complicated problems with the most cutting-edge solutions. But all this innovation couldn't keep the lights from going out.

Does anybody have a battery pack? It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
