<h1> "'Star Wars' Musical Pencil Video Goes Viral" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm David Greene. This is the famous "Cantina" theme from Star Wars.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN WILLIAMS' "CANTINA BAND")</p>
    <p>GREENE: And this - and I need you to listen closely here - is the song being played on a pencil.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PENCIL ON PAPER)</p>
    <p>GREENE: Yeah, a college student in Arizona posted video of herself writing an algebra equation, and her pencil movements recreate the song - sort of. A story in The Arizona Republic suggested she call her band Lead Zeppelin. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
