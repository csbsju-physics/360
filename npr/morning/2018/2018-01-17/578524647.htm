    <p>Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin with a suggestion for your summer vacation. The Klingon tourist center opens in Stockholm next month. The center will introduce visitors to the culture and customs of the "Star Trek" warrior race.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "STAR TREK")</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character, speaking Klingon).</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Fans will also get to tour a replica of the Klingon capitol city. There will be singalongs, dancing and a battle reenactment - and when it's all over, a traditional glass of blood wine. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
