<h1> "New Jersey Has A New Law Against Droning While Intoxicated " </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. Here's a sign of the times, right? New Jersey now has a law against drunk droning. Governor Chris Christie signed it just before leaving office. This may be a good idea. I did a quick search and found a story about a Canadian woman hit in the head when a 3-pound drone fell from the sky. A drone crashed on the White House lawn. In Washington state, one almost hit a news helicopter. And it looks like all those drone operators may have been sober. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
