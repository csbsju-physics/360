<h1> "Friendly Skies: Pope Marries Couple On A Plane Over Chile" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin. Pope Francis was flying out of Santiago, Chile. And as usual, he took time to meet all of the flight attendants. When he met a couple named Carlos and Paula, he asked if they were married. The couple said they had planned to tie the knot next month but their Catholic church was destroyed in a massive earthquake. The pontiff asked if they'd like him to marry them right then and there. They said yes and got married by the pope on a plane. Sort of beats your story about getting a free upgrade, right? It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
