<h1> "Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Patience - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell came back to that word several times when he spoke yesterday about the Fed's decision to hold off on raising its key interest rate.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>JEROME POWELL: In this environment, we believe we can best support the economy by being patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>The Fed raised rates four times in 2018. But yesterday, Powell gave reasons to pause.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>POWELL: Including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations and the effects from the partial government shutdown in the United States.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: To be clear, the Fed still thinks the U.S. economy is strong - just not strong enough to need another interest rate hike right now.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>POWELL: The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Now, the Fed's decision is surely what President Trump wanted. He's been hammering the Fed over higher rates, which might affect the economy and, not incidentally, the president's re-election chances. Powell insists, though, that Trump was not a factor.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>POWELL: We're never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The president once wrote on Twitter that the Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch.</p>
