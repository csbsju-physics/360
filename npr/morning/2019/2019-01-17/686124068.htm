<h1> "Public Embrace In Egypt Gets 2 College Students Punished" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. Video in Egypt showed a college student on his knees proposing to another student.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Foreign language spoken).</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: She leaped into his arms. He spun her around, and people watched.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Cheering).</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And then he was suspended from college - for two years. And she was expelled. A public embrace is frowned upon in Egypt. But after a public outcry, the punishment has been reduced. For their expression of joy, they will only be barred from first semester exams.</p>
