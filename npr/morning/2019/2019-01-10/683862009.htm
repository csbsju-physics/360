    <p>PINKFONG: (Singing) Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo, baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo, baby...</p>
    <p>MARTIN: That's right. "Baby Shark," the viral kids' song, is making its debut on the Billboard Top 40.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Sorry, all you parents with little ones. You cannot escape this song.</p>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>No, you cannot. "Baby Shark" has been around for years as a children's song that you would hear at camp or other places. And then in 2016, Pinkfong, a South Korea-based educational brand, recorded a version of it. And it went viral.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: It's gotten 2.1 billion views globally on YouTube and inspired a legion of imitators in other genres, like R&B.</p>
