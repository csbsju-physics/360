<h1> "Pet Cat Claws Expensive Painting By 17th Century Portrait Artist " </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. An arts expert in Britain bought a portrait that was done by one of his favorite artists. The Telegraph reports he paid around $6,000 for it. He was restoring the portrait because there were a couple of little tears on it, which seems like a total waste now since his cat Padme decided to launch herself at the painting and rip a huge hole in it with her claw. The guy says at least the massive hole is not on the subject's face. Still, it's catastrophic.</p>
