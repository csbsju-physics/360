<h1> "People Around The World Toast To Robert Burns' 260th Birthday" </h1>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS' "AULD LANG SYNE")</p>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind - the opening lines of "Auld Lang Syne," a song people often turn to while ringing in the new year.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Its words were written by Robert Burns, and today marks his 260th birthday. He's regarded as the national poet of Scotland. Here's Dr. Pauline Mackay, a lecturer in Robert Burns studies at the University of Glasgow.</p>
    <p>PAULINE MACKAY: Robert Burns has done a great deal to take Scotland to the world. It's through Robert Burns that Scottish culture has been communicated in places that it may not have been otherwise.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: One of his works is "Ae Fond Kiss," sung here by Scottish singer-songwriter Eddi Reader.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "AE FOND KISS")</p>
    <p>EDDI READER: (Singing) A fond kiss, and then we sever - a farewell, alas, forever.</p>
    <p>ALISON WALKER: His legacy is the way he wrote and the compassion with which he wrote about a whole range of subjects.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: That's Alison Walker. She's a journalist and member of the Guild of Burns Speakers (ph).</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Who knew?</p>
    <p>MARTIN: That means she toasts Burns' accomplishments at what are called Burns suppers.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Burns suppers have roots in the 1800s. People gather together on Burns' birthday to celebrate his works, a tradition that has spread.</p>
    <p>WALKER: Honestly, everywhere, to - in more than 200 countries, there will be a Burns supper happening, which is phenomenal. It's just phenomenal. And they will all follow the traditional format.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The format includes toasts and traditional Scottish dishes - another way that Burns has helped to spread Scottish culture.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: So tonight maybe consider some haggis for dinner, a little Scotch whisky to toast the great poet.</p>
