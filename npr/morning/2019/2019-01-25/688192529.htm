    <p>Rachel, how did you know? Anyway, that's where Donte Colley comes in.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF INSTAGRAM VIDEO)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Colley makes Instagram videos. It's just him, dancing in front of the camera by himself.</p>
    <p>DONTE COLLEY: I start by throwing on a song and hitting record on my iPhone and kind of just improvising a little bit of a dance.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: With his perfectly timed twirls and twists, he edits in emojis that pop up on screen - stars and fireworks and hearts, confetti explosions.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSIONS)</p>
    <p>COLLEY: I really have no idea what is going to happen. So it's, like, kind of like a fun journey for everything.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And there is giant text over all the images, feel-good phrases like, keep going. You matter. You complete this planet.</p>
    <p>COLLEY: I just wanted to encourage my friends to really just push through through any kind of struggle that they are going through. And social media is a great platform to do that.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Using social media to spread a positive message. And many people have responded.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: This week, Colley took his show on the road, showing off his moves on "Good Morning America."</p>
