<h1> "Afghan Veteran Helps Retired General Colin Powell Change Flat Tire" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. General Colin Powell says thanks. The former secretary of state, who turns 82 this year, had a flat tire and had trouble changing it until Anthony Maggert saw him and stopped. Maggert has a prosthetic leg after being wounded in Afghanistan which did not keep him from helping. Powell posted a photo of Maggert on social media, writing you touched my soul with a reminder of why the country is great. Powell added, let's just take care of each other.</p>
