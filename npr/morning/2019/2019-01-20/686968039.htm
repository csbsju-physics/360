<h1> "Sunday Puzzle: You're Halfway There" </h1>
    <p>LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>And it's time to play The Puzzle.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Joining us as always is Will Shortz. He's puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzlemaster. Good morning, Will.</p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what was last week's challenge?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. It came from listener James Matthews of Little Rock, Ark. And it was worded very carefully. I said the challenge is to make a nine-letter word meaning left using only a B and one D. Can you do it? And the answer is abandoned. Something that's been abandoned has been left. And that - if you read those letters in order, it's a B and one - O-N-E - D.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: We received more than 1,000 responses. And our winner this week is Jeff Selleck of Alpine, Wyo. Congratulations, and welcome to The Puzzle.</p>
    <p>JEFF SELLECK: Thank you. Hi, Will. Hi, Lulu.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Hi there.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hi. So how did you solve it?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Well, my girlfriend - wife Tara and I were out splitting wood. And we've done this a few times - the puzzle there. And I read it to myself. And I said to her, this doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. So I read it...</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: (Laughter).</p>
    <p>SELLECK: I read it very slowly. And I said, it seems more like a riddle than a puzzle. And she just reflexively said, is it abandoned? And we thought about it and counted it out and realized, oh. It's written right there, so yeah.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. And what do you do for a living, Jeff?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Well, I am a builder. And in the winter, I also teach skiing at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, which is where you found me.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow. Take me with you. I know Wyoming has some great ski slopes.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: It does. We're in the middle of a quite powerful storm cycle, so skiing's great.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. That's the only place in the country where, actually, storm cycles are a good thing.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Are you ready to play The Puzzle?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Sure, I am.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. Take it away, Will.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right, Jeff. Every answer today is a compound word or a familiar two-word phrase in which the first part has a long I sound. And the second part has a long E sound. For example, if I said, color akin to chartreuse, you would say, lime green.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: OK.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Number one, a dish that's a la mode comes with what?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Ice cream.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Ice cream is it - an area that may be marked off with police tape.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Crime scene.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Crime scene, good - to completely remove, as fingerprints from a surface.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Wipe clean.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it - home plate umpire's call immediately before you're out.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Yes, strike three.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it - area beyond where first and second basemen play.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: I'd love to say outfield, but that doesn't quite work.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: What part of the outfield?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: (Laughter) Ah.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: It's not the left part.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Jeez.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: What's the opposite of left?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Ah, right field.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Right field is it, good - to transmit an event over the Internet as it occurs.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Live stream.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. It has needles for leaves.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Oh, pine tree - we have lots of those here.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: I bet you do - piece of paper that records how long a worker spends on a job.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: A time sheet.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Head of a department that puts out conflagrations.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Oh, a fire...</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yeah.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: ...Chief.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Say again.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: A fire chief.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Fire chief is it - not a main thoroughfare.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: A side street.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. And here's your last one - Colorado summit that completes the phrase blank or bust.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Pikes Peak.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Pikes Peak is it. Good job.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Good job. How do you feel?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: I feel great.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, you did great. For playing our puzzle today, you'll get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin as well as books and games. You can read all about it at npr.org/puzzle. And what member station do you listen to?</p>
    <p>SELLECK: I listen to KUWJ in Jackson, Wyo., and KUWA in Aspen, Wyo.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jeff Selleck of Alpine, Wyo., thank you for playing The Puzzle. And enjoy the snow.</p>
    <p>SELLECK: Thanks, guys. It's been a pleasure.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Will, what's next week's challenge?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes, it comes from listener Steve Baggish (ph) of Arlington, Mass. Take the name of a classic song that became the signature song of the artist who performed it. It has two words - five letters in the first word, three letters in the second. And these letters can be rearranged to spell two new words. One is a feeling, and the other is an expression of that feeling. What song is it? So again, famous song - it's a signature song of the artist who performed it. Two words - five, three - and the letters can be rearranged to spell two words. One's a feeling, and the other is an expression or what you might do with that feeling. What song is it?</p>
