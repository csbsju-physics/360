<h1> "Federally Funded Companions Keep Seniors Connected To Their Neighbors" </h1>
    <p>LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>Isolation is an issue for many seniors, especially in rural places. It can lead to loneliness, which many experts consider a serious public health issue. As Maine Public Radio's Patty Wight reports, for decades, a federal program has addressed the problem the old-fashioned way - sending visitors door to door.</p>
    <p>PATTY WIGHT, BYLINE: Most days of the week, you can find Kitty Gee making house calls among the mountains of western Maine.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)</p>
    <p>KITTY GEE: Hello.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Gee is a senior companion. It's a federal grant program that operates in nearly every state. The idea is simple - connect isolated seniors to a friendly visitor every week. On this day, Gee visits Wanetta Nurse.</p>
    <p>GEE: How's my best girl today? You're doing good, eh? Looking pretty as always.</p>
    <p>WANETTA NURSE: Good to see you, Kitty.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Gee is a spry 87. Nurse is only 74, but she has health issues that make it hard for her to walk or even to pursue former hobbies, like knitting and sewing.</p>
    <p>NURSE: When Kitty showed up, that was like, oh, yay.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: During the visits, Gee keeps the conversation upbeat - chatting about family, the old days and men.</p>
    <p>GEE: I've been trying to find a dancing partner. They're hard to find because, you know, people our age, they're not - they don't want to do much, you know? And you and I, we're ready to roll. We want to get moving.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Gee became a senior companion nearly five years ago after her husband died. She was at loose ends, she says, and needed something to do.</p>
    <p>GEE: So I said this will get me out among people. I'll have someone to talk to. And maybe I'll do some good.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: She visits seven clients each week and receives a federal stipend - $2.65 an hour. Being a companion, Gee says, gives her a purpose. And Nurse says the visits give her something to look forward to.</p>
    <p>GEE: (Laughter).</p>
    <p>NURSE: I mean, sometimes, she's laughing so hard. You know, it's just so nice to see someone laughing. And then to be included in that, too, means a lot.</p>
    <p>KERRY FARIA: These programs, I think, are essential for our aging populations in our state.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Kerry Faria is with the local nonprofit SeniorsPlus, which partners with the University of Maine to implement the senior companion program.</p>
    <p>FARIA: Many times, people will end up isolating themselves because their friends are dying around them. Their family - maybe their siblings are - have died off. I mean, they may be the only one left out of their generation. So they just find themselves kind of alone.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Around 600 seniors receive the service in Maine. But there's a waitlist of more than 300. The demand is likely to increase as the population ages. More companions are also needed, says Faria, especially men, though there are a few.</p>
    <p>BUD HOUGHTON: I'm Bud Houghton. I am 66 years old.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Houghton is a former logger. After he retired, he jumped at the chance to become a senior companion.</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: They need that friendship. They need that companionship. You are their ticket to the outside world.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: Hello.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Today, he's visiting 61-year-old Bill Gates.</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: You want to go for a ride?</p>
    <p>BILL GATES: Yeah.</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: All right. I'll get the car backed up then.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Gates has dementia. Houghton likes to take him to scenic outlooks. The visit is as much to provide companionship as it is to give Gates' wife some respite.</p>
    <p>GATES: (Humming).</p>
    <p>WIGHT: Gates hums as they wind along the roads of western Maine. Being a companion, Houghton says, isn't always easy. He's witnessed clients deteriorate. Some have passed away. But these relationships, he says, are deeper than his other friendships.</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: It changes you. You end up doing things for other people. It's not you that's important. It's their well-being that's important.</p>
    <p>WIGHT: And it's the simple things, Houghton says, like taking someone for a picnic lunch or a ride in the car that make a difference.</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: That's "Silent Night," isn't it?</p>
    <p>GATES: Yup.</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: Awesome.</p>
    <p>GATES: I'm not trying put the...</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: Love that song.</p>
    <p>GATES: Yeah - always trying to keep me (ph) away from it.</p>
    <p>HOUGHTON: (Laughter).</p>
    <p>WIGHT: For NPR News, I'm Patty Wight.</p>
