    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>And now we take a moment to remember guitarist Reggie Young.</p>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>You might not know that name, but you certainly are familiar with some of the monster hits he played in, like Dusty Springfield's "Son Of A Preacher Man."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF DUSTY SPRINGFIELD'S "SON OF A PREACHER MAN")</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And Elvis Presley's "Suspicious Minds."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SUSPICIOUS MINDS")</p>
    <p>ELVIS PRESLEY: (Singing) We're caught in a trap.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Young started his career in Memphis and eventually headed to Nashville in the 1970s. He was one of the most revered and in-demand session players of the time.</p>
    <p>GREENE: He played guitar in Neil Diamond's "Sweet Caroline"...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SWEET CAROLINE")</p>
    <p>NEIL DIAMOND: (Singing) Where it began, I can't begin to knowing.</p>
    <p>GREENE: ...And also the sitar intro on "Hooked On A Feeling" by B.J. Thomas.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF B.J. THOMAS SONG "HOOKED ON A FEELING")</p>
    <p>GREENE: After playing sessions with The Highwaymen, which included Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, Young joined them on tour for several years. And in 1997, he was nominated for a Grammy for best country instrumental performance in "Going Back To Memphis."</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Young died on Thursday of heart failure. He was 82 years old. B.J. Thomas tweeted out his remembrance - calling Young the, quote, "greatest guitar player of them all," in his book.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Young's first ever album, a collection of his hits from Memphis to Nashville, is due out later this month.</p>
