<h1> "911 Operator Helps Young Student Burdened By 'Tons Of Homework'" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Rachel Martin. A 911 dispatcher named Antonia Bundy took a call earlier this month from a boy who sounded frustrated and sad.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I had a really bad day, and I don't know.</p>
    <p>ANTONIA BUNDY: What happened at school that made you have a bad day?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I just have tons of homework.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Which is not a reason to call 911. But Bundy wasn't busy, so she helped the young man work through what clearly felt to him like a math emergency. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
