<h1> "Alexa Interrupts Chipmaker Qualcomm Presentation At CES" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. BuzzFeed is reporting on a freaky moment at a tech conference. A representative from Qualcomm was saying that smart speakers can recommend hotels and restaurants.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>ALEXA: No, that's not true.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>GREENE: It is not clear why Alexa chimed in there. And is this really funny? I mean, I've been scared of technology since HAL's voice in "2001: A Space Odyssey." Let's just end this segment.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY")</p>
    <p>DOUGLAS RAIN: (As HAL) I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Oh, God.</p>
