<h1> "Actor Hugh Grant Would Like His Film Script Back " </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. Ernest Hemingway once suffered a disaster for a writer. His wife lost a suitcase full of his manuscripts. This is not exactly the same, but the actor Hugh Grant lost a film script. It is hard for him to grab another because, he says, he spent weeks covering it with notes. He says it was in a bag that was stolen from his car. He is appealing for the script to be returned and also, he says, his kids' medical cards. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
