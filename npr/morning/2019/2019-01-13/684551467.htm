<h1> "Sunday Puzzle: A Capital Challenge" </h1>
    <p>LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>It's time to play the Puzzle.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Joining us, as always, is Will Shortz. He's puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzlemaster. Good morning, Will.</p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu. Welcome back.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Thank you. What was last week's challenge?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes, it came from Joel Fagliano. I said, name a major U.S. city in 10 letters. If you have the right one, you can rearrange its letters to get two five-letter words that are synonyms. What are they? In the capital of Sacramento, you can rearrange those 10 letters to get aroma and scent.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: We received 502 responses. And our winner this week is Tova Tenenbaum of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p>Congratulations.</p>
    <p>TOVA TENENBAUM: Thank you so much. Hi, Lulu. Hi, Will.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Hey, there.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hi. What do you do for a living, Tova?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: I'm a social worker. I work for the VA, the Department of Veterans Affairs. And I work with homeless veterans.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: So are you working during this shutdown?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Fortunately, yes, I am working. And I'm also being paid. I'm very fortunate.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: And are the vets getting the help they need?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: They are, yeah. We have a great program for permanent subsidized housing for them.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Great. That sounds like it's a lot of hard work. What do you do for fun?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Well, besides playing the weekly Puzzle, I do the crossword every night before bed. I play Quizzo every week, which is what they call pub trivia here in Philadelphia. And I have a therapy dog who comes with me to work, and he comes on hikes with me and just all over the Philadelphia area.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: I bet you those vets like that therapy dog.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: They love him, yes.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes (laughter).</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: He loves it, too.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: What's his name?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: His name is Ernie.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Ernie.</p>
    <p>All right, are you ready to play the Puzzle, Tova?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: I am.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Take it away, Will.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Well, every answer today is the name of a U.S. state capital.</p>
    <p>Which state capital rhymes with noisy?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Boise.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Good. Contains the letters of combs, C-O-M-B-S, in left-to-right order.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Columbus.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Good. Which state capital consists of the chemical symbols for gold and sulfur followed by the full name of a third chemical element?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: So gold is Au.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Right.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: So I'm going to go with Augusta.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: No.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: No?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: But that does start - and the second, the symbol for sulfur.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Austin.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Austin is right, ending in tin - Austin, Texas. Which state capital contains a silent O as its third letter? And here's your hint - this is a capital in the Southwest.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Phoenix.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Phoenix - good one. Which state capital ends in an O sound but does not contain the letter O?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Juneau.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Nice. Consists of a candidate for president in 1988 plus a president in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Gosh, a candidate for president in '88 - so I know...</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Right. He wasn't nominated. He failed in his run for the nomination.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: It's a little before my time.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: OK. And how about a president of the 1970s?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: That would be Ford. No.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Ford is good. Ford is correct.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: OK.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: What state capital ends in F-O-R-D?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Frankfort - no.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's not quite. Oh (laughter). That's F-O-R-T. You need F-O-R-D.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Oh, you're right.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: And think in the Northeast.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Let me see here.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: The Nutmeg State.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: There you go.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: The Nutmeg State?</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: I know (laughter) - the insurance capital.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: There you go.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Oh - the insurance capital?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right. We'll just tell you, the capital of Connecticut...</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Oh.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Which is a lovely state...</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Hartford...</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: ...And both nutmeg and insurance, I don't think, do it justice.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: I had no idea either of those things are related to Connecticut.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: (Laughter) Hartford is right, as in Gary Hart. And your last one - which state capital ends with the first name of this program's host?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Ends with Lulu?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Oh - Honolulu.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Honolulu, Hawaii - good job.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Good one.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: There you go. Finally, I made it into the Puzzle - my goodness. My ship has finally come in.</p>
    <p>How do you feel? You did great.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Thank you. I feel relieved, and that was really fun.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: I feel like all of that sixth grade stuff came up - bubbled up to the surface.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Definitely.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: And you were able to tap that knowledge.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Definitely.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: For playing our Puzzle today, you'll get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin as well as puzzle books and games. You can read all about it at npr.org/puzzle. What member station do you listen to?</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: I am a proud member of WHYY in Philadelphia.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tova Tenenbaum, thank you for playing the Puzzle.</p>
    <p>TENENBAUM: Thank you so much.</p>
    <p>GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, Will, what's next week's challenge?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes, it comes from listener James Matthews of Little Rock, Ark. And the challenge is to make a nine-letter word meaning left using only a B and one D. Can you do it? So again, make a nine-letter word meaning left using only a B and one D. Can you do it?</p>
