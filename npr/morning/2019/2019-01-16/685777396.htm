<h1> "UCLA Coach Helps Star Gymnast Find Her Way Back To A Sport She Loves" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>All right, you may have seen it by now. There's this viral video of a 21-year-old UCLA gymnast earning a perfect 10 while performing this crazy difficult floor routine.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TINA TURNER SONG, "PROUD MARY")</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering).</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>She does flips that just seem impossible. She sticks every landing. She dances effortlessly and bounces across the floor.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Her name is Katelyn Ohashi, and effortless is really the word. She's out there and just looks joyful, like she's having fun.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF THE JACKSON 5'S "I WANT YOU BACK")</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering).</p>
    <p>VALORIE KONDOS FIELD: Honestly, when you see her, it's like - the happiness that you get when you see a puppy, that's Katelyn Ohashi.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Valorie Kondos Field or Coach Val, as she is called, is the head coach of the UCLA gymnastics team.</p>
    <p>KONDOS FIELD: She just exudes goodness and love and joy.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Katelyn Ohashi has devoted her life to gymnastics. Before joining UCLA, she was a teenaged Olympic hopeful who seemed destined to earn a spot on Team USA.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF 2012 KELLOGG'S PACIFIC RIM CHAMPIONSHIPS)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR #1: This is unbelievable.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR #2: Watch this - full.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR #1: Beautiful.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR #2: And just tremendous exercise from Katelyn.</p>
    <p>GREENE: But the elite level came at a price - not just the injuries but the body-shaming, the cut-throat competition that left her questioning her self-worth. Katelyn wanted out.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And she introduced herself to Coach Val, said she was looking for a new start - this time at the college-level.</p>
    <p>KONDOS FIELD: And I remember asking her - Katelyn, when was the last time that you just loved gymnastics? And she had just won the American Cup, so she was the greatest gymnast in the world. And she said, I lost my love for the sport when I was 11. She was miserable.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Coach Val tried to help her find a different way.</p>
    <p>KONDOS FIELD: I realized that I had to earn her trust that I cared about her more as a human being than as an athlete and I cared about her in spite of her gymnastics.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: It shows in that video. During her entire floor routine performance, Katelyn Ohashi is smiling.</p>
    <p>GREENE: And this is all especially meaningful for Coach Val because, after nearly 30 years as head coach for UCLA Gymnastics, this will be her final season - and what a way to go out.</p>
    <p>KONDOS FIELD: And so many people have said that as well, that Katelyn Ohashi is really what we need right now.</p>
