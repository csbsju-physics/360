<h1> "Seattle Public Transportation Has Gone to The Dogs \u2014 Well, One Dog" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene with a positive commuting story for once. Jeff Young's dog, Eclipse, rides the bus with him a few times a week in Seattle. But if the bus pulls up to the stop and Jeff isn't quite done smoking his cigarette, well, Eclipse hops on without her owner. The driver lets her on, and she leaps over other passengers to grab a window seat. Jeff hitches the next bus, and they meet up a few stops later. So where does this canine commuter disembark? Well, that would be a dog park, of course. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
