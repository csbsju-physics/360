<h1> "Police Chase Ends In Ohio Prison's Parking Lot" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. Police in Toledo, Ohio, tried to stop a car early yesterday morning. The vehicle sped away, leading to a brief pursuit that ended in a convenient location - the Toledo Correctional Institution. After circling the facility, the driver ran over one of those rows of metal spikes - oops. All four tires were punctured. The driver is facing resisting arrest as well as vandalism for ramming the gate of the prison parking lot. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
