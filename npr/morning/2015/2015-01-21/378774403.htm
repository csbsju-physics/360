<h1> "Oldest Woman In Scotland Knows The Secret To A Long Life" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. The oldest woman in Scotland says she knows the secret to living a long life - eating a nice warm bowl of porridge every day and avoiding men. 109-year-old Jessie Gallan never married and says men are just more trouble than they're worth. Not convinced? Well, the oldest living person in the world celebrated her 116th birthday last March. And the Japanese woman - yes - has been a widow for 83 years. I really hope that my wife is not listening to this. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
