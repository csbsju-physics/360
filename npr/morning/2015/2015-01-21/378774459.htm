<h1> "Obama's Speech Included Historic Words" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>President Obama made some history last night and caused quite a buzz online when he used some new words in his state of the union address.</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>According to observers, it was the first time a president used the words lesbian, transgender and bisexual in a state of the union speech.</p>
    <p>GREENE: And another first came when he mentioned Instagram, the popular image-sharing social network.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: But perhaps nothing set off social media more than this...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I have no more campaigns to run.</p>
    <p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>OBAMA: My only agenda...</p>
    <p>GREENE: Those cheers are from Republicans.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)</p>
    <p>OBAMA: I know 'cause I won both of them.</p>
    <p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>GREENE: And that round of applause of course came from Democrats. Even as the president was talking about rising above politics, just a little bit of political gloating from both sides of the aisle.</p>
