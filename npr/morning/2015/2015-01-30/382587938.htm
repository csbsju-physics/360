    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. Richard Sherman is in suspense. The Seattle Seahawks' cornerback is preparing for the Super Bowl Sunday. He's also preparing to be a father. His girlfriend is expecting a son. Mr. Sherman says he's hoping the boy will wait to make an appearance until after the game. And he's right to hope that.
