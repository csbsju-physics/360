<h1> "No More's Anti-Domestic Violence Spot To Air In Super Bowl" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Pro football continues paying penance for some players' involvement with domestic violence. A couple of weeks ago, we told you of an ad campaign involving the NFL and advocacy groups.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF AD CAMPAIGN)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: No more boys will be boys.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: No more what's the big deal?</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>And now the ad campaign called No More will make it to the Super Bowl. It's a good guess the message will cause some living rooms to fall silent.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: You see no people, just shots of a home in chaos. You hear the sound of a woman who calls 911 and pretends to order a pizza.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF AD CAMPAIGN)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: OK, ma'am. Is everything OK over there? Do you have an emergency or not?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Yes.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF BEEP)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: And you were unable to talk because...</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Right. Right.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: The operator eventually figures out she needs a cop. The message urges all of us to listen to those who can't speak up. It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
