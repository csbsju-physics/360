<h1> "Rhode Island School Releases Snow Day Video" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. Of all the ways to declare a snow day, this may be the best. The Moses Brown School in Providence, R.I., released a music video featuring the head of schools.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC VIDEO, "SCHOOL IS CLOSED")</p>
    <p>MATT GLENDINNING: (Singing) School is closed, school is closed 'cause it snowed so much last night. School is closed, school is closed, so I stay at home and sit tight.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: So that song will be stuck in your head all day. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
