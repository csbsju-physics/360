<h1> "Thieves With A Guilty Conscience Return Stolen Items" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. A Boy Scout troop in Montana got its camping gear back after thieves had a change of heart. After taking the gear and a trailer worth about $7,000, the thieves left a note on the windshield of a car in a church parking lot saying they felt guilty and directing the scouts from Troop 373 where to find their stuff. There might not be a merit badge in that, but Scoutmaster Rick Lindholm was happy that the thieves had done a good deed. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
