<h1> "From A Frequent Flier To SkyMall, Thanks For The Memory Foams" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p>
    <p>Where am I going to get a Bigfoot garden yeti statue, or a Grillbot automatic grill-cleaning robot, or a strike-a-pose zen yoga frog statue?  This week, the company that publishes the SkyMall in-flight catalog filed for bankruptcy. Now, you may wonder - how can a company that sells Boise State Bronco or Purdue Boilermaker pet beds for $90 dollars or Chicago hot dog-scented T-shirts for $28 go bankrupt? Well, it may not be the goods, but the tech.</p>
    <p>With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, chief executive Scott Wiley said in court papers, fewer people browse the SkyMall in-flight catalog. And he added that more airline in-flight Wi-Fi, quote, "resulted in additional competition from e-commerce retailers and additional competition for the attention of passengers." I don't know, I never had a problem paging through SkyMall instead of - I don't know, what are they - yeah, the New York Times - that's it.</p>
    <p>SkyMall had sales of about $33 million in 2013, which fell to only 15.8 million through the end of September last year. Mr. Wiley said he hopes a new buyer might run SkyMall as a scaled-down enterprise. SkyMall will be auctioned in March, so this might be a propitious time to stock up on Brew-to-Go Beer Sippy Cups or T-shirts that proclaim - I came, I mowed, I kicked grass.</p>
