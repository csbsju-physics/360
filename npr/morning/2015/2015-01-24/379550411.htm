    <p>SIMON: The editor-in-chief of the AARP Magazine is Robert Love, who is the former managing editor of Rolling Stone. That also sounds like a milestone. The interview is timed to coincide with Mr. Dylan's 36th studio album, recording of classic American songs called "Shadows In The Night." Bob Dylan on the cover of AARP Magazine. How does it feel? Don't think twice. It's all right.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "FOREVER YOUNG")</p>
    <p>BOB DYLAN: (Singing) May you grow up to be righteous. May you grow up to be true. May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you. May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong. And may you stay forever young. May you stay forever young.</p>
