    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. In the rugged terrain around LA, you really do not want to come face-to-face with a bear. And when Sheriff's Deputy Ricky Hernandez was lowered by helicopter to check out an abandoned car in the brush, he didn't realize the chopper had scared off a big bear.
