    <p>And if you spend this New Year's Day in front of a screen, you have a choice. You can watch college football or take in one of the movies our listeners recommended on Facebook. Jean Ann Woll (ph) told us her favorite New Year's movie is "When Harry Met Sally," including the final New Year's party scene.</p>

    <p>MEG RYAN: (As Sally) You see? That is just like you, Harry, you say things like that, and you make it impossible for me to hate you.</p>
