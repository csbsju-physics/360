<h1> "Fallen Prey To Love's Cruel Sting?" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. Fallen prey to love's cruel sting - consider the San Francisco Zoo's Valentine's Day special. Adopt a giant hairy scorpion in honor of your ex-lover because, according to the zoo, scorpions are also low-lifes. The zoo will send a certificate to the person who inspired the adoption, or perhaps a Madagascar hissing cockroach. The zoo says that donation could cure, quote, "your love life karma" so you never have to encounter a cockroach again. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
