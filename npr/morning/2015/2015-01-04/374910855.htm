<h1> "Former Sen. Edward Brooke Of Massachusetts Dies At 95" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>This country's first popularly elected African-American senator has died. Edward Brooke was 95.</p>
    <p>Brooke led an impressive life. After graduating from college, he became a soldier in World War II. And like most black service members, he faced open discrimination. He described his time on a segregated base in Massachusetts as, quote, "filled with frustration and bitterness." Still, he went on to earn a Bronze Star and a Distinguished Service Award.</p>
    <p>After the war, Brooke earned two law degrees and got involved in Massachusetts state government as a liberal Republican. In 1966, while many blacks were still struggling for the right to vote, Ed Brooke was elected to the U.S. Senate.</p>
    <p>He described himself as a moderate when it came to civil rights and famously said he was not a civil rights leader. History will likely see it differently. President Obama said Edward Brooke, quote, "stood at the forefront of the battle for civil rights."</p>
