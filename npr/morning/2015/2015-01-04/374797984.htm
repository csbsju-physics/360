<h1> "A Winter Puzzle To Brrring In The New Year" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. You have opened all of your holiday gifts, maybe you've kicked off your New Year's resolutions. But before you get a chance to break them, let's do the puzzle.</p>
    <p>Joining me now is WEEKEND EDITION's puzzle master, Will Shortz. Happy New Year, Will.</p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ, BYLINE: Happy New Year, Rachel.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Can you remind us of last week's challenge?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yeah. I thought it was a tough one. I said take the five-word sentence - Those barbarians ambush heavier fiances. And I said these five words have something very unusual in common. What is it? And as a hint I said look at the letters in the words, you don't need to scramble. Well, the letters in the odd positions in each word name part of the body - toe, brain, abs, hair and face.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK, so we received around 445 correct answers. Our randomly chosen winner is Caryn Hart of Havertown, Pennsylvania. She joins us on the line now. Caryn, congratulations.</p>
    <p>CARYN HART: Why thank you, and Happy New Year...</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Happy New Year to you.</p>
    <p>HART: ...To you and Will.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Thank you.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And it's a great thing, you get to be our first puzzle champion of 2015.</p>
    <p>HART: I'm excited but, of course, nervous.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: You're going to be great. You're going to be great. I also understand that a winning streak runs in your family.</p>
    <p>HART: It does. My husband, amazingly, was selected about a little over a year ago.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: As our puzzle contestant. That's crazy.</p>
    <p>HART: Yes, we were both stunned that he was selected because odds are, we believe, rather small.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Pretty small. And the two of you.</p>
    <p>HART: Really.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: You got some good luck. You need to go buy a lottery ticket or something.</p>
    <p>HART: Exactly.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And you've been playing the puzzle for a long time, the two of you?</p>
    <p>HART: I think since the beginning, but I can't remember not doing it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Oh, wow. Yeah. That's a long time. OK, are you ready to play the puzzle Caryn?</p>
    <p>HART: I will try.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: You will try, and you will succeed. I bet you will succeed.</p>
    <p>HART: We'll see. I will appreciate any help I could have from you, Rachel.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: I am here for you every step of the way.</p>
    <p>HART: OK.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK, Will, let's do it.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right, Caryn and Rachel. The title of today's puzzle is Brr. Every answer is a familiar two-word phrase or title in which the first word starts with the letters B-R and the second word starts with R. For example, if I said a thing grasped on a merry-go-round, you would say brass ring.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: OK, you got it, Caryn?</p>
    <p>HART: Yes.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: All right, let's give it a go.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Number one, lead character in a story told by Uncle Remus.</p>
    <p>HART: Brer Rabbit.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That is correct. Number two, a restaurant freebie that usually comes in a basket.</p>
    <p>HART: A bread...</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: And what is it?</p>
    <p>HART: A bread roll.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: A bread roll, yeah, that's it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Bread roll.</p>
    <p>HART: Bread roll.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Sure.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. Your next clue is Crimson.</p>
    <p>HART: Bright red.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Bright red is it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Good.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: What a woman signs up for at a store when she's about to be married.</p>
    <p>HART: Registry - bridal registry.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Bridal registry, yes. Twenty-three-year third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Oh.</p>
    <p>HART: This one I have to pass on.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Oh, man. They're all kinds of baseball fans...</p>
    <p>HART: Don't know sports.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: ...Out there who are cursing me right now. Sorry everyone. I do not know my Baltimore Orioles roster.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right, I'll just tell you. People are screaming at their radios all over the country. The answer is Brooks Robinson.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Of course. Sorry, Brooks.</p>
    <p>HART: Okay.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: OK, a leafy vegetable whose buds have small heads.</p>
    <p>HART: Broccoli rabe.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. Try this, area of the house in which to have the morning meal.</p>
    <p>HART: Breakfast room.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. And here's your last one, a nominal thing you win when there's no actual price.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: A WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Just kidding. Just kidding.</p>
    <p>HART: What's the clue one more time?</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Nominal thing you win when there's no actual prize.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: You just go around saying, hey, I won. I'm so awesome.</p>
    <p>HART: Bragging rights.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Yeah.</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Bragging rights is it.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Like you're going to do right after you get off the line with us because you did such a great job on the puzzle.</p>
    <p>HART: Well, I tried.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: But you did great, Caryn. And for playing the puzzle today, you get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin and puzzle books and games. You can read all about your prizes at npr.org/puzzle. And before we let you go, where do you hear us? What's your public radio station?</p>
    <p>HART: WHYY out of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Great. Caryn Hart of Havertown, Pennsylvania. Thanks so much for playing the puzzle, Caryn.</p>
    <p>HART: Well, thank you very much. I'm glad it worked out OK.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: It was great.</p>
    <p>HART: And Happy New Year again.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Happy New Year to you.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: And, Will, what is the challenge for next week?</p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yeah. Last fall, I posed a challenge in which you were asked to name a country, change one letter in it and rearrange the result to name a world capital and then change a letter in that and rearrange the result to name another country. And the answer was Spain to Paris to Syria.</p>
    <p>Well, listener Andrew Chaikin of San Francisco has posed a related puzzle. Name a world capital, change a letter in it and rearrange the result to name a country. Then, change a letter in that and rearrange the result to name another world capital. What names are these? So again, start with the world capital, changes a letter, rearrange, name a country, change a letter in that and rearrange. And you'll name another world capital. What geographical names are these?</p>
