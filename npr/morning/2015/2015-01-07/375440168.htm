<h1> "Marian Anderson's Groundbreaking Met Opera Moment" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>This next story marks an anniversary. It was 60 years ago today that the Metropolitan Opera had its first African-American soloist. That's the occasion for this story, but really any excuse will do to play the voice of Marian Anderson.</p>

    <p>MARIAN ANDERSON: (As Ulrica) (Singing in foreign language).</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>That is a recording from one of Anderson's performances in 1955 as the fortuneteller Ulrica. She played the role in an opera by Verdi.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: F. Paul Driscoll, the editor-in-chief of Opera News, says Marian Anderson was made for that role.</p>
    <p>F. PAUL DRISCOLL: The role of the sorceress, Ulrica, in "Un Ballo En Maschera," is something which depends a lot on the charisma of the performer, the presence of the performer and the ability to suggest a world beyond what you're seeing in front of you. And that's what Marian Anderson did every time she walked on stage, not to indicate that she was a sorceress. She had magic of a very different kind. But I think if you're going to have the first African-American artist at the Met be Marion Anderson, let her appear at her best.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: She did her best, though, even as an accomplished performer in her 50s, Marian Anderson was nervous.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: She said afterward that she trembled. And when the audience applauded her appearance on stage, quote, "my stomach tightened into a knot." Nevertheless, a New York Times reviewer reported that her performance made men and women cry.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The Opera News's F. Paul Driscoll says that moment 60 years ago opened the doors for performers who came after Marian Anderson.</p>
    <p>DRISCOLL: The country didn't change overnight. There were still problems with taking African-American artists on tour for the Met throughout the '50s and the '60s. You know, in other words, it's not as if everything became completely rosy in 1955. But I think that seeing this is an important symbol, that this was the beginning of the integration in the deepest sense of classical music in the United States - that's why its important.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Marian Anderson's mere appearance at the Met 60 years ago was as dramatic as the story she acted out on stage.</p>
