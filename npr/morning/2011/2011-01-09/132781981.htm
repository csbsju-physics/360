    <p>HANSEN: Bagpipes sounded in honor of the victims of yesterday's tragic shooting. In addition to the wounding of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and the killing of federal judge John Roll, five others were murdered, and 12 more wounded. </p>
    <p>Among the dead: congresswoman Giffords' director of community outreach, Gabe Zimmerman, age 30; Dorothy Morris, age 76; Dorwin Stoddard, also 76; and Phyllis Scheck, age 79. </p>
    <p>But the death that hit many of us the deepest is that of the youngest victim, 9-year-old Christina Taylor Greene, who had gone to the event to meet the congresswoman. Christina was the granddaughter of former Philadelphia Phillies manager Dallas Greene. According to the Arizona Daily Star, she was an athletic child who liked to swim, and was the only girl on her Little League team. She played second base. </p>
    <p>Christina Greene had just been elected to the student council at her elementary school. She told her parents she wanted to attend Penn State and make a career of helping those less fortunate. She loved ballet, hip-hop and jazz. </p>
    <p>Our thoughts go out to all the families and friends of those shot yesterday in Tucson. You can follow coverage throughout the day on this public radio station, and at NPR.org. </p>
