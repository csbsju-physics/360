<h1> "Ariz. Lawmakers Unite Over Giffords\u2019 Shooting" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>Throughout today's program, we're reporting on the shooting in Tucson yesterday that left six people dead and at least a dozen wounded, including Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Reaction was swift and heartfelt, especially from Giffords' fellow Arizona lawmakers. </p>
    <p>Governor Jan Brewer said: All of Arizona is shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific tragedy. She added, I am just heartbroken. Gabby is more than just a colleague; she is my friend. She has always been a noble public servant. </p>
    <p>Senator John Kyl offered condolences to the family of U.S. District Court Judge John Roll and others who were killed and wounded. He said: We pray for the recovery of Representative Giffords and the others who remain in critical condition. Congresswoman Giffords is also a good friend, and I find it especially saddening that such a heinous crime would occur while she was fulfilling her congressional responsibilities. </p>
    <p>Arizona Senator John McCain said he was horrified by the attack. Whoever did this, he said, whatever their reason, they are a disgrace to Arizona, this country and the human race; and they deserve and will receive the contempt of all decent people and the strongest punishment of the law. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
