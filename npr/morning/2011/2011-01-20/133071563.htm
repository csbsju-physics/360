<h1> "USDA Approves Green, Bio-Based Product Label" </h1>

    <p>Now, the government is pushing nonpetroleum alternatives, as NPR's Elizabeth Shogren reports.</p>
    <p>ELIZABETH SHOGREN: Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan says people will start seeing the logo this spring.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Consumers want to know, with the plethora of labeling claims in the marketplace, that what they're investing their dollars in is meaningful; that it's backed by some sort of certification.</p>
    <p>SHOGREN: Companies already have introduced thousands of products made from plants or animals instead of petroleum. That's because of a law that requires the federal government to buy such products - if they exist and are affordable.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: We probably would not see the growth of these products without this program.</p>
    <p>SHOGREN: Stephen Censky is the executive director of the American Soybean Association. His group pushed Congress to require the switch.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: That helps drive demand, and then it scales up manufacturing so then it can be available to the general public.</p>
    <p>SHOGREN: Elizabeth Shogren, NPR News, Washington.</p>
