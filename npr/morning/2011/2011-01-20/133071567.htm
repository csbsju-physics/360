    <p>David "Cricket" Shaw, of the Library Bar in Columbus, Ohio, says you might drink it without knowing it.</p>
    <p>M: Say you just walk into a place and you just order a cranberry and vodka, you're getting that. Usually, it's the house - or the well, they call it.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Kamchatka vodka is named after a Russian peninsula that sticks out into the Pacific Ocean, but it is actually distilled in Kentucky.</p>
    <p>M: Saying it's good may be an overstatement; you don't do shots with it. It's a mixer.</p>
