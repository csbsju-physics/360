    <p>Unidentified People (Singing) Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can...</p>

    <p>SIMON: Except open on Broadway. "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" has delayed its opening for the fifth time, the show's producers announced this week. Four people have been injured during rehearsals and previews since last November. Inspectors are examining the show's safety procedures. It takes a lot of modern technology to get Spidey to fly. The producers say that the increased preview period will allow for more technical rehearsals.</p>
    <p>U: Unidentified People (Singing) Whenever there's a hang up you'll find the Spider-Man.</p>
