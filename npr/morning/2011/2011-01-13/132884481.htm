    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>Leaders of Darby Township, Pennsylvania approved a new parking violation. It's a saving-a-space violation. After all this winter snow, some people use traffic cones or chairs to save the parking spots they shoveled. Township commissioners do not approve. They say this can lead to fights. Now you can have your fight with the parking police, because saving a space is a violation punishable by a fine of up to $300.</p>
