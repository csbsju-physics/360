<h1> "King Tutankhamen's Farewell Tour" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>And now to what we consider art. From Egypt, a major exhibit in this country is going home. The King Tut exhibit has been here five-and-a-half years in eight cities, and has received nearly eight million visitors. A specially designed museum is going up in Egypt and will permanently house the gilded treasures of the boy king.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: spectacle, art and archeology.</p>
    <p>Jesse Baker has our report.</p>
    <p>JESSE BAKER: The ancient Egyptians believed if your name lived on after you died, then you would enjoy eternal life. If they're right, King Tut is a pretty spry 3,000-year-old. King Tut is a phenomenon and a cultural touchstone.</p>
    <p>Stephen Colbert's top story of 2010 was the pharaoh's missing metaphoric royal jewels.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE COLBERT REPORT")</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: So what could this Egyptian treasure be? Well, it turns out Princess Scota was the half sister of King Tut. Oh, my Ra.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>BAKER: King Tut provoked laughter even 30 years ago. This is Steve Martin's homage.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "KING TUT")</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: (Singing) Born in Arizona, moved to Babylonia, King Tut.</p>
    <p>BAKER: Now, for a few more days, some of Egypt's most prized and promoted possessions can be found in the heart of Manhattan's Times Square, tucked between the Broadway production of "Spider-Man" and the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>BAKER: You are sealed into a tomb-like room to start the exhibit and shown a short film narrated by Omar Sharif. The film ends. Doors to the gallery open into darkness. The only light you see is that illuminating a statue of a boy. This is your introduction to King Tut.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF KING TUT EXHIBIT FILM)</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Come face to face with the boy king, the ruler, the commander, Tutankhamen.</p>
    <p>BAKER: Consider seven-year-old Cordelia Zawaraski unimpressed. She came to see one thing.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: The mummy.</p>
    <p>BAKER: What did it look like?</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: How do I know? It's not open.</p>
    <p>BAKER: Not only is Tut's mummy not open, to be honest, it's not really on display here in New York. Instead, the exhibit features a life-sized, 3D replica based on CT scans of the actual mummy. Tut's real remains have never left the Valley of the Kings.</p>
    <p>There are twice as many artifacts on display here than in the landmark King Tut Exhibit in the late 1970s.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: When the exhibition toured in the '70s, Egypt saw very little money from that very, very successful exhibition.</p>
    <p>BAKER: That's Mark Lach, senior vice president of Arts and Exhibitions International. That's the organization that collaborated with the Egyptian government to bring King Tut back to the U.S.</p>
    <p>So basically, what was billed in the 1970s as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and displayed for a few bucks, 30-some years later become a twice-in-a-lifetime opportunity and charged 29.50 a ticket.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: I think bringing the exhibition here to the United States to raise funds for Egypt was a very important part of the reasoning to bring the exhibit1ion to the United States.</p>
    <p>BAKER: Tut and his golden entourage will return to Egypt having earned about $80 million. The money will be spread around. Some will aid the preservation of Egyptian temples and monuments. But the majority will pay for the construction of The Grand Egyptian Museum - the final, final resting place for the Boy King's treasures. No more traveling exhibits, we're told.</p>
    <p>New Yorker Michael Gold said he was happy to get in just under the wire.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And I had a lot of these things in my house. I wanted to come to see the real things, you know. Thank goodness I came to see it before it disappeared. I couldn't wait another 40 years.</p>
    <p>BAKER: There's one more stop on the king's comeback tour in Melbourne, Australia, as the relics await completion of the museum in Giza.</p>
