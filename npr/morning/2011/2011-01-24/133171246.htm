    <p>MONTAGNE: Amazon.com is planning to offer a regular home delivery service for groceries. The Financial Times reports that Amazon plans to focus on food and other low-priced household goods, the kinds of goods that people use most often. The company has had a pilot program for weekly home deliveries in Seattle, and is now recruiting staff for a broader rollout. </p>
    <p>Amazon could face competition from Wal-Mart which, according to The Financial Times, is also developing an online strategy for groceries and other household goods. </p>
