<h1> "Crocodile Swallows Cell Phone Dropped By Visitor" </h1>

    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>Workers at an aquarium in Ukraine didn't believe a visitor who told them one of its crocodiles had gulped down her cell phone, until that is, the croc started ringing. The woman said she was leaning over the water trying to get a photo when she dropped the phone right into the mouth of the crocodile. </p>
    <p>The woman said she just wants to get her SIM card back with photos and addresses, but the poor croc hasn't been able to expel the phone. </p>
