<h1> "Teens Accused Of Stealing From Stranded Motorists" </h1>

    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>Karma caught up with some Missouri teens last week. According to police, the three young men posed as good Samaritans just trying to help motorists stuck in the snow. But instead of helping the stranded motorists get free from their cars, police say the teens took their wallets and credit cards. Their getaway, though, was short-lived. The Kansas City Star reports that police found the suspects when they, too, got stuck in the snow. </p>
