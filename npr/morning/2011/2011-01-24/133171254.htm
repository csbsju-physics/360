<h1> "Pub Owner To Sell His Own Brand Of Irish Whiskey" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>And today's last word in business, whiskey rebellion. </p>
    <p>In Minneapolis, a pub called the Local sells more Jameson Irish Whiskey than any other bar or restaurant in the world. Jameson is a big whiskey brand and its parent company, Pernod Ricard, confirmed Local's status. Local's sales are due in part to its passionate whiskey loving owner, Kieran Folliard. </p>
    <p>Mr. KIERAN FOLLIARD (Owner, The Local): I'm actually only 25 but I look about 70. I mean all the whiskey I've been drinking myself over the years. I have down for 12 bottles a day. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Hey, I thought whiskey preserved you. </p>
    <p>Folliard does say he's joking. But the Irishman has worked to cultivate sales, coming up with whiskey cocktails and nudging customers towards his favorite drink. </p>
    <p>Mr. FOLLIARD: If somebody comes in and asks for a Jack and Coke, we'd say well, you know, you're in an Irish pub. You've got to try an Irish drink. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: But Folliard is now jumping ship. He's giving Jameson the boot and launching his own whiskey brand. He'll import it from a small distillery in Ireland and says the move is more in keeping with his scrappy image. Selling his own brand will cut down on costs too. </p>
    <p>Mr. FOLLIARD: It's a cutthroat environment and we've got to keep trying to figure out how to stay a step ahead of the posse. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Jameson's parent company, Pernod Ricard, was in public at least, magnanimous about losing its top seller. The company emailed NPR a statement saying it wished, quote, the Local the best with their new whiskey venture. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
