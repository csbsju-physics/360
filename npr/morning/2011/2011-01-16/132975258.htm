<h1> "Your Letters: Tucson Shooting" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, Host: </p>
    <p>Much of last week's program was devoted to the coverage of the shootings in Tucson. We followed the police investigation as it unfolded and details slowly began to emerge. And we took a moment out to remember the six people who were killed.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF BAGPIPES)</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Last night, at the Statehouse in Phoenix, Arizona, stunned residents gathered for a vigil.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF BAGPIPES PLAYING "AMAZING GRACE")</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Bagpipes sounded in honor of the victims of yesterday's tragic shooting. In addition to the wounding of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and the killing of federal judge John Roll, five others were murdered and 12 more wounded.

    <p>HANSEN: My colleague WEEKEND EDITION SATURDAY host Scott Simon and his family are friends with Gabrielle Giffords and her family. Last week, Scott had this personal essay about the Congresswoman. Here's an excerpt.</p>

I've heard her complain about the constant strain of raising money and getting middle seats on long airplane flights but never about meeting with her constituents, even if it's just to hear harangues.

    <p>HANSEN: Listener Don Gillam(ph) went to our website and wrote that Scott's commentary forced him to stop and pause for a moment. I'm so sorry, he wrote. I've become almost numb to news stories about tragedy. We hear them every day, but listening to the stories about Representative Giffords, then hearing details about the nine-year-old girl that died, I just can't hold the tears back. So sad.</p>
