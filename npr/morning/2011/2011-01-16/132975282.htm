<h1> "Flooding Doesn't Dampen Australia Open" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, Host: </p>
    <p>For a preview, Douglas Robson, who reports on tennis for USA Today, joins us from member station KQED. Welcome to the program.</p>
    <p>DOUGLAS ROBSON: Oh, it's a pleasure to be here.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Now, I understand you're not attending the Australian Open this year but you've been to other Australian Opens a number of times. How does this compare to the other Grand Slam events?</p>
    <p>ROBSON: Well, Roger Federer once called the Australian Open the happy slam. If Wimbledon is staid and clubby and traditional and the U.S. Open is high octane and glitz, the Australian Open feels like a giant Barbie break. There's a real festive atmosphere.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah. Let's talk about this season's cast of characters. Rafael Nadal of Spain, Roger Federer, they've had this great rivalry in recent years. What do you expect from them in Australia and this entire season?</p>
    <p>ROBSON: Federer, of course, is the record holder. He has 16 majors, more than any other player, and is a defending Australian Open champion. And he comes in after really being the hottest player on tour the last few months. He beat Nadal in the year-end championships. But you almost have to tip Federer as the favorite.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Who are you watching on the women's side?</p>
    <p>ROBSON: I think with the Williams sisters sort of being in and out - Serena is the defending champ in Australia and won't be there, Venus will be there but she's hardly played in the last few months and it's hard to know what to expect from her.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: Are you excited about this season?</p>
    <p>ROBSON: I mean, you've got Federer who's sort of walking on air and Nadal who's the muscular grinder and it's a great contrast in a really special time in the sport.</p>
    <p>HANSEN: The Australian Open begins tomorrow. Douglas Robson covers tennis for USA Today and he joined us from NPR member station KQED. Thanks so much.</p>
    <p>ROBSON: Thank you.</p>
