    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Many consumers seem to have spent more in December, but not necessarily at Best Buy. The consumer electronics chain said today its revenue in December fell 1.6 percent compared with the same month last year. The company cited weak sales of TVs and video game-related products. Better deals at rivals may also have siphoned away sales, which were down 4 percent at outlets that have been open for more than a year.</p>
