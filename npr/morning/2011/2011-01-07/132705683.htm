<h1> "Despite Positive Signs, Jobs Still Hard To Find" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>NPR's Brett Neely has this report on where the new jobs are coming from.</p>
    <p>BRETT NEELY: The jobs are out there. But sometimes, as Jessica Cooper found out, it takes six months and lowered expectations to find them. She's an experienced bookkeeper in the construction industry - no jobs there for awhile. Throughout her job search, she kept seeing lots of jobs in the health care industry - which kept adding positions through the recession.</p>
    <p>M: And I felt like every time I was doing a job search, it was for nurses and physician assistants and things like that, and I don't have any training in that sort of a thing.</p>
    <p>NEELY: So Cooper wound up with a part-time job selling clothes at The Gap. It pays $12 less an hour than her old job.</p>
    <p>M: It was kind of disappointing, but at the same time, I mean, I knew that was the way it was going to be. I just needed a job.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>M: So I went for it.</p>
    <p>NEELY: Macy's spokesman Jim Sluzewski says the chain will add 3,500 positions over the next two years to beef up its online operations. Many of the jobs will be relatively low-paying jobs packing boxes for shipment. But Sluzewski says the company is hiring plenty of other workers, too.</p>
    <p>M: Merchants - which are buyers and planners - to programmers, to software engineers.</p>
    <p>NEELY: While many large companies are once again profitable, labor economist Gary Burtless at the Brookings Institution says they're cautious about spending the big cushions of cash they've built up.</p>
    <p>M: Businesses have to be confident that the demand for the good or product that they sell is going to be reliably bigger in the future than it is right now.</p>
    <p>NEELY: That rings true for Bill Cave in Fort Mill, South Carolina. He's been unemployed for two years and finally starts a new job on Monday.</p>
    <p>M: The job is a temporary position. It's for a staffing company, doing research on the clients that they have.</p>
    <p>NEELY: Most of those jobs are thanks to orders from overseas, says Boeing spokesman Tim Neale.</p>
    <p>M: Particularly in Asia and the Middle East, but also in places like Africa and Latin America, where passenger traffic is on the rise.</p>
