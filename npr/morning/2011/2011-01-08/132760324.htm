<h1> "Poetry From A Police Blotter" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, host: </p>
    <p>Police logs in the newspaper are often kind of dull: names, dates and a terse description of the crime committed, usually about all you get. But the Rochester Times Police Log is packed with poetry and puns. </p>
    <p>New Hampshire Public Radio's Dan Gorenstein reports. </p>
    <p>DAN GORENSTEIN: Listen to this. </p>
    <p>Mr. JOHN NOLAN (Editor, Rochester Times): At Halloween upon a street where youngsters go for Trick-or-Treat, a worried parent calls the cops. His kid has been handed Hall's cough drops. A curiosity has gripped us - Cherry, Mint or Eucalyptus? Dad makes the point it's medication not the stuff of celebration. Police check out this plot of terror and find it was a simple error. </p>
    <p>GORENSTEIN: John Nolan writes the police log and edits the Rochester Times. He's delivered tales of odd and scary behavior for some 22 years now - some of it with his signature puns, some of it in rhyme. But Nolan used to write it like everyone else. </p>
    <p>Mr. NOLAN: Kind of tedious and dreadful. </p>
    <p>GORENSTEIN: So one night he decided to try a little experiment </p>
    <p>Mr. NOLAN: (Unintelligible)wrote: A dog barks on 10 Rod Road. And I added: Deep in a forest a berry drops, because I had been reading some Japanese haikus so that was in mind. </p>
    <p>GORENSTEIN: Managing editor Rod Doherty says he's a little surprised just how popular Nolan's police log is. </p>
    <p>Mr. ROD DOHERTY (Executive Editor, Rochester Times): If it doesn't appear, I will start to hear from people: Where's the Rochester Police Log? Of course(ph) I started thinking, hey, we put all this on the news and the paper all the time, and you're calling up because the police log's not in there. </p>
    <p>Mr. NOLAN: On Winter Street, a lady pushes a gentleman through a window to air a grievance. </p>
    <p>GORENSTEIN: Some readers point out: These are serious issues, not jokes. That line about airing a grievance makes you smile, until you think about what happened. Was that sexual assault? Was it a break-in? To a certain extent Nolan agrees with the sentiment. </p>
    <p>After 17 years as a Glasgow, Scotland cop, he understands the ugliness of crime. But he says it's that job that taught him how to cope. </p>
    <p>Mr. NOLAN: You'd see the very worst of behavior. But it was always lightened a little bit or softened by sort of gallows humor. That's how people get by. </p>
    <p>GORENSTEIN: Nolan doesn't just want people chuckle - he's using crime to tell a story about how people live together. </p>
    <p>Mr. NOLAN: 5:47 p.m., with only a crescent moon teens have to fight under a street light. 1:27 a.m., The people in the raucous Granite Street apartment are at it again, banging on walls and yelling louder than ever. 8:12 p.m., spring has arrived - a bike is stolen from a Charles Street driveway. </p>
    <p>GORENSTEIN: Nolan thinks one reader nailed it when he said the log is gritty, with the self-confidence to poke fun at its own goings-on. </p>
    <p>For NPR News, I'm Dan Gorenstein in Concorde, New Hampshire. </p>
    <p>Mr. NOLAN: In a different part of town, there is another cause to frown. Trick-or-treaters all are shocked, for after a man's door is knocked he answers it not how he should. He keeps appearing in the nude. </p>
