<h1> "Chicago\u2019s Daley Dynasty Moves Into White House" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, host: </p>
    <p>There used to be a saying about the first Mayor Daley: Daley doesn't want to be president, he just wants to send one of his boys down to the White House. Now he has, as William Daley becomes White House chief of staff. </p>
    <p>The great columnist Mike Royko used to refer to the mayor's sons, Rich and Bill Daley, as Prince Larry and Prince Curly. But columnists can be as wrong as politicians. Richard M. Daley is now completing his sixth term as mayor of Chicago, and Bill Daley is being called to the White House. Richard J. Daley was a legend. It would please any father to see that his sons haven't been eclipsed by his shadow. </p>
