<h1> "Your Letters: Aussie Floods; Vitriol; Law And Order" </h1>

    <p>You're listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News </p>
    <p>Time now for your comments. Yvonne Hubmayer(ph) of Rochester, Minnesota listened with interest and appreciation to our interview with Australian broadcaster, Richard Glover, about the devastating floods in Queensland. Ms. Hubmayer is from Australia, and quoted a song by a fellow countryman, John Williamson, called, "Thargomindah." You wait two years for a decent rain to save a thirsty crop, now it's going yellow 'cause the bloody rain won't stop. But that's the way it is where inland rivers flow, and irony that real bush people know. </p>
    <p>We heard from many of you about last week's discussion with Erik Deggins of the St. Petersburg Times about vitriol in the media. Kathy Corcoran of Flagstaff, Arizona thought we missed why conservatives are frustrated. The point conservatives are trying to make is that there is enough vitriol to go around, she writes. It's not from one side as the media suggests. </p>
    <p>We spoke last week with the stars of - dum dum - Law and Order UK, and found out that Bradley Walsh was once a comedian. </p>
    <p>Mr. BRADLEY WALSH (Actor): I probably packed it in about 12 years ago and then started acting. It just seemed like a good idea at the time, there was nothing else to do. </p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, you haven't packed it in, love. He still makes us laugh when the camera's not rolling (unintelligible). Yeah. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. WALSH: But it was something I enjoyed, but, you know, time to move on. It's a young man's game, stand-up comedy. </p>
    <p>SIMON: Bianca DeLille of Washington, D.C. says she loves the show. I didn't know anything about the actors, so it was a total kick in the pants to learn about their backgrounds and get a glimpse of their personalities. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of Song, "The Kids' Song") </p>
    <p>Mr. TOMMY RETTIG (Singing): Now just because we're kids, because we're sort of small, because we're closer to the ground, and you are bigger pound by pound. You have no right, you have no right to push and shove us little kids around. </p>
    <p>SIMON: With the soundtrack from "5,000 Fingers of Dr. T" was released. The 1953 movie musical was the brainchild of Dr. Seuss, and it bombed. Not with our listeners. It's clearly a passionate fan base out there. </p>
    <p>David Munoz from West Linn, Oregon remembers the film from an annual all-night movie festival at UC Santa Cruz. Well, though each year the bevy of films might change, one thing remained constant, "The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T" was always the last film shown. Those of us able to make it to the end were always amazed, if not dazed and confused, by this surrealistic feature that always was a topic of discussion while walking back to the dorms as the sun was coming up. </p>
