    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>A mountain climber in Scotland had just reached a summit when he lost his footing. Adam Potter, of Glasgow, fell 1,000 feet down a rocky slope. A military helicopter happened to be in the area and when they reached him, paramedics did not expect to find the climber alive - much less discover him standing up, reading a map. Potter suffered only scrapes and bruises after tumbling down from the height of the Eiffel Tower. </p>
