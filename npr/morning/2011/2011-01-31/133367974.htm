<h1> "Some Fans Can Watch The Super Bowl From The Air" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>It's not too late to get a ticket to the Super Bowl. It just might have to be a plane ticket. At least three airlines have decided to offer the Super Bowl telecast on their flights. JetBlue will offer the service for free to passengers who just can't wait to land. Frontier and most Continental planes will also have the game but there, you have to pay $6 in order to watch - or else lean over toward the passenger who's next to you. </p>
    <p>You're listening to MORNING EDITION. </p>
