<h1> "Learning To Live A Full Life With Chronic Illness" </h1>

    <p>Commentator Toni Bernhard has been living with a chronic illness for the last 10 years. </p>
    <p>TONI BERNHARD (Author, How to Be Sick): In 2001, I had the next couple of decades of my life mapped out. I'd be teaching law, visiting my children, and attending Buddhist meditation retreats. </p>
    <p>Suddenly, everything changed. I got sick with flu-like symptoms. A doctor said it appeared to be an acute viral infection. </p>
    <p>I have yet to recover. The infection has left me mostly housebound, and often bed-bound. </p>
    <p>For the first few years of being sick, I lived in what I can only describe as a state of shock. When I didnt recover, I blamed myself. It took me almost six years to find my way back to a life of fulfillment and joy. The journey started when I looked more deeply at the Buddhas first noble truth: Everyones life has its share of both joy and suffering. Resisting the plain fact of my illness only added mental suffering to the physical suffering. </p>
    <p>And I remembered something a teacher had said: If your compassion doesnt include yourself, it is incomplete. This was a turning point for me. Slowly but surely, I stopped blaming myself for getting sick. I also took up a Buddhist practice called mudita: cultivating joy in the joy of others. I hoped it would be an antidote to the painful envy that overcame me when I heard of other people going to family gatherings, or even a movie. I didnt always succeed. I kept working at it, though, and gradually, the feeling of joy in others joy became genuine. Now when my husband visits our children and grandchildren, I feel as if hes there for both of us. </p>
    <p>One of the toughest challenges was accepting isolation. But over time, I learned to open my heart and mind to being by myself. Ive had to be inventive. Instead of traveling to see my children, I stay close to them by instant messaging and texting. Ive traded the role of teacher for that of student, by studying classical music and opera. </p>
    <p>It has taken several years  and many tears  to learn how to thrive in my new life. I still have rough days, when I wish I could do whatever I want. But really, who can do that anyway? On the whole, Im content and at peace with what I can do, even if its from the bed. </p>
