<h1> "Oscar Nominations Get Hollywood Up Early" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Odds are that people in Hollywood are getting up early this morning. That's because Oscar nominations are announced today, continuing the frenzy of an awards season that includes red carpets, gown fittings and ad campaigns. Reporter Kim Masters is following all the hubbub and she spoke with Renee Montagne.</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE: Let's start with best picture. Ten films will be nominated, and I'd like to get the speed prediction of all 10.</p>
    <p>KIM MASTERS: All right. Here I go. "Social Network," "King's Speech," "Black Swan," "The Fighter," "The Kids Are All Right," "Inception," "Toy Story," "True Grit." The three in contention for two remaining slots - "127 Hours," "The Town," and "Winter's Bone."</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: OK, so there you go - 11 contenders anyway. What about a clear favorite? I mean I would have thought that "Social Network" would have been right there.</p>
    <p>MASTERS: And you would have had a lot of company, but this past Saturday the Producers Guild gave out their awards, and they are pretty good predictors. So up until then it had been "Social Network" with this critics group and "Social Network" for the Globe. But Saturday night "The King's Speech" won with the producers, and they were the ones who were early pickers of "The Hurt Locker" when it was up against "Avatar." They were early pickers of "No Country for Old Men." They bat pretty good when it comes to predicting Oscars, so now the race is on its ear and it's a real horse race.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And does that horse race then include the star of "The King's Speech," Colin Firth?</p>
    <p>MASTERS: I feel like Colin Firth had locked up best actor, you know, when I saw it in Toronto. It is the story of King George the VI reluctantly having to take the thrown on the eve of World War II. He has a stammer. We're going to hear a clip now in which he meets his speech therapist, a commoner played by Geoffery Rush, for the first time.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "THE KING'S SPEECH")</p>
    <p>GEOFFREY RUSH: (as Lionel Logue) In here it's better if we're equals.</p>
    <p>COLIN FIRTH: (as King George VI) If we were equals, I wouldn't be here. I'd be at - at home with my wife and no one would give a damn.</p>
    <p>MASTERS: Colin Firth feels like the guy to beat in best actor.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Let's move on to best actress.</p>
    <p>MASTERS: Well, the best actress contest seems to be held in the hands right now of Natalie Portman. She's with a new guy. She's got the cute little baby bump. She's running around town telling everyone how happy she is. She is in "The Black Swan," which is a movie that has confounded expectations, certainly in Hollywood. Strange movie made by Darren Aronofsky, who did "The Wrestler," about, you know, sort of a psycho-drama behind the scenes, production of "Swan Lake." And let's take a listen to what might be an Oscar-winning performance by Natalie Portman.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "BLACK SWAN")</p>
    <p>VINCENT CASSEL: (as Thomas Leroy) I see you obsess, getting each and every move perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself. All that discipline for what?</p>
    <p>NATALIE PORTMAN: (as Nina Sayers) I just want to be perfect.</p>
    <p>CASSEL: (as Thomas Leary) You what?</p>
    <p>PORTMAN: (as Nina Sayers) Want to be perfect.</p>
    <p>MASTERS: Wants to be perfect, might win.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Last question on this - there's, I mean, plenty more to talk about with the Oscars, but I gather there's an issue this year over whether a couple of performances will be recognized as starring or supporting roles.</p>
    <p>MASTERS: And the other one is Lesley Manville, a small movie called "Another Year." She plays sort of a confused and apparently alcoholic friend of this very happy married couple. It's a great performance. Supporting or best actress, or simply left out of the race - we'll soon find out.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That's Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter, also host of THE BUSINESS on member station KCRW. And we'll check back with Kim after the nominations are announced later this morning.</p>
