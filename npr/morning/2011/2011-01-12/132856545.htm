    <p>Not long ago, my family took a carriage ride around Philadelphia. The driver mentioned Thaddeus Kosciuszko and said he was the guy who built New Jersey's Kosciuszko Bridge. Never mind that Kosciuszko was a Revolutionary War hero in the 1700s and the bridge was finished in 1939. Now, Philadelphia tour guides are in court. They are challenging a 2008 law that would require them to pass a history test. They say it violates free speech. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
