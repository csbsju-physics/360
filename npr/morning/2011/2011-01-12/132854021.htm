    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>It's Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>And I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
    <p>NPR: Good morning.</p>
    <p>JASON BEAUBIEN: Good morning.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Jason, 200,000 people died on this day a year ago today, how are Haitians marking this tragedy?</p>
    <p>BEAUBIEN: MONTAGNE; And, Jason, you arrived there and begin reporting right after the earthquake. Remind us what it was like a year ago.</p>
    <p>BEAUBIEN: A year later, things are obviously much better than that. But that was a day that Haitians say that they're never going to forget.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And what about today? When you walk around the city, what do you see?</p>
    <p>BEAUBIEN: So there's a lot of frustration here with where things are right now, with a sense that people want to be moving forward faster than things moved over this last year.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Well, yesterday, former President Bill Clinton joined Haiti's prime minister to announce a new investment in Haiti. They say it will create thousands of jobs. Have business and commerce come back to life at all since the quake?</p>
    <p>BEAUBIEN: In Port-au-Prince, commerce has come back in terms of a lot of the commerce that was always here, people doing things in the streets, people selling things. You know, right underneath some rubble that's about to - looks like it's about to fall over, you'll have women selling oranges and selling slippers and selling medicine. That kind of commerce has come back, but certainly, this is a difficult place to work. A lot of the infrastructure has been damaged and - you know, this country has a long, long way to go to getting back to normal.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And just very briefly, Jason, Haiti's recovery has been bedeviled by cholera and also political chaos. Is there any sense of optimism that things will get better any time soon?</p>
    <p>BEAUBIEN: The big question is when will things get better? I think Haitians have confidence that, yes, things will get better, but the question is how long is that going to take.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Joining us from Port-au-Prince, NPR's Jason Beaubien, thanks very much.</p>
    <p>BEAUBIEN: You're welcome.</p>
