<h1> "FBI Launches 'Bureau Special' To Probe Shooting" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Dina, good morning.</p>
    <p>DINA TEMPLE: Good morning.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: What are investigators learning?</p>
    <p>TEMPLE: You know, a case has to be built. And it helps the prosecution if there actually is a motive found.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And that motive rests somewhere in a mind that, by the indications we have so far, was in some way disturbed. Which does raise the question of how, even with hundreds of agents, you pin that down.</p>
    <p>TEMPLE: Basically, anybody who's had any contact with him in the past three to five years, they're trying to find him - find those people and find out what might have motivated him.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Now, these hundreds of agents, Dina, you described this as a Bureau Special or they describe it as a Bureau Special. What does that mean exactly?</p>
    <p>TEMPLE: You know, he was killed, as it turns out, by an organized crime figure named Charles Harrelson. And just as an aside, do you remember Woody Harrelson from "Cheers," the bartender?</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Oh, sure.</p>
    <p>TEMPLE: It was his dad who actually killed this judge. Anyway, this was an early Bureau Special. And now this Tucson case is the latest one.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Now, you said that that took months to do that investigation. Does anybody have any idea how long it might take to have the fullest view possible of what really happened in Tucson, Arizona, and what the shooter was really thinking - the alleged shooter was really thinking?</p>
    <p>TEMPLE: And they have to build a case, and then, of course, bring it before jury.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Dina, thanks as always.</p>
    <p>TEMPLE: You're welcome.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That's NPR's Dina Temple-Raston this morning.</p>
