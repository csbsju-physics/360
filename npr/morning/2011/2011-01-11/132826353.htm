    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>The former Republican leader in the House of Representatives is facing prison time. Tom Delay was sentenced yesterday to three years for conspiring to send laundered money to Republican candidates. And so we can say that Tom Delay kept his word. He told us in 2007 he would never give up. </p>
    <p>I wonder, are you prepared to say that you will not take a plea bargain, no matter what? </p>
    <p>Mr. TOM DELAY (Former Republican Representative, Texas; Former House Majority Leader): No matter what. I'm not guilty of anything. And I will not succumb to the Democrats' criminalization of politics. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Former House Majority leader Tom Delay echoed that statement in court yesterday. As he received his sentence, he insisted he had done nothing wrong. </p>
