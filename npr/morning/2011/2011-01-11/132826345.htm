    <p>Now, let's talk about environmental standards. The Philadelphia Eagles may be out of the playoffs but fans can console themselves with the knowledge that their stadium may soon be the greenest. And it's not just that green is one of the Eagles' colors. </p>
    <p>Eagles' owner Jeffrey Lurie and his wife Christina Lurie have been retrofitting Lincoln Financial Field. They're adding wind turbines, solar panels and a biodiesel power plant. </p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>The changes are aimed partly at reducing utility costs, which are the second biggest expense for the team, behind payroll, according to the LA Times. </p>
    <p>There will also be plenty of recycling, of course. Even the beer cups are made from biodegradable plastic and will be composted along with the grass clippings from the field. </p>
    <p>And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
