<h1> "Circus Employee Must Get Permission To Walk Tigers" </h1>

    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>Bears and coyotes roaming the backyards of America hardly merit a mention, much less a 911 call. But in a village in Germany, the sight of a man walking a tiger cub was enough for one resident to call the police. They didn't arrest him, though. It turns out he was caring for three tigers while the Russian circus he works for was on a break. So police gave him a permit to walk the tigers, as long as he notifies them first. </p>
