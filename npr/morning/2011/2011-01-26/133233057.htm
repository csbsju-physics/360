    <p>And today's last word in business is solar powered pants. </p>
    <p>The Silver Lining clothing company has developed a fashion line that integrates solar panels into its fabrics. Green fashionistas will be able to charge a mobile device by plugging it into a pocket of these loose fitting, striped cargo pants. Which work as long as you're sitting in the sun, I guess. But solar powered fashion is not cheap. The pants cost about $920 per pair. </p>
