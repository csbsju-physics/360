    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>An unlikely couple celebrates 10 years together this month at an eco-lodge in New Zealand. The pair has been inseparable since they met in 2001. She met him shortly after the death of her partner. He met her shortly after his birth. If it sounds unconventional, it is. He's a highland bull. She's a goose, and a possessive one. The gardener at the lodge says the goose is extremely jealous. A goose, after all, keeps the same partner for life. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
