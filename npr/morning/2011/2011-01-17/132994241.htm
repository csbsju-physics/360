<h1> "Motives Sought In Arizona Shooting" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the investigation continues into what motivated the accused gunman. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady with the latest.</p>
    <p>JEFF BRADY: The alleged gunman, 22-year-old Jared Loughner, is in federal custody and the FBI has taken the lead role in the investigation. Pima County Sheriff Spokesman Jason Ogan says federal agents have control of the evidence now. But there is still the matter of state charges that could be filed against Loughner.</p>
    <p>JASON OGAN: We are still going through some things and we have meetings with the county attorney here later this week to discuss what charges are, you know, we going to pursue. Can we mirror the federal charges? You know, is it going to be a double-jeopardy kind of deal? Or do we have to, you know, scale back a little?</p>
    <p>BRADY: At the Safeway where the shooting happened, the store reopened this weekend and shoppers gingerly pushed carts past a memorial near the front door. There are piles of flowers, lit candles, stuffed animals.</p>
    <p>PEG ANDERSON: There's a sign that says United against hate and violence.</p>
    <p>BRADY: Peg Anderson lives just about a quarter-mile from here and she stopped by to take a picture. Thinking back to a week ago, she remembers all the talk, prompted by Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, that a nasty political environment might have led to the shooting. Then Anderson agreed, but now says she's not sure. She wonders how anyone could know what was happening in Jared Loughner's mind.</p>
    <p>ANDERSON: And so I think it's dangerous to attribute it to anything that has been said or happened, but I can understand why there's that reaction. I had that reaction myself. And I do think this has made everybody sit up and pay attention to how they treat each other.</p>
