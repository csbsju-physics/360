<h1> "African Americans And The Internet" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>Martin Luther King's civil rights campaign included a call for equal access to public spaces. Today, the internet is one of those public spaces, and access for African Americans differs from that of whites. IT consultant Anjuan Simmons joins us to talk about some of those differences. Good morning.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Good morning.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Let's talk about access to the internet. Theoretically, of course, it's all equal, but in fact, there are different ways in which African Americans get on the Internet. What's one of them?</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: What we're finding is cell phones are a common way that people of color are getting online. And one reason for that is, as opposed to a laptop, which often costs several hundred dollars, you can get a subsidized cell phone from a carrier for a lot less. And so you have a cost savings where you can get a cell phone that has a relatively high speed connection to the Internet, and I think that that low cost, ease of access, mobile approach is really attractive to African Americans.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: So more so than whites, African Americans get on the internet through cell phones. Does that affect how they use social media?</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Yes, since so many people of color have access to the Internet through their cell phones, then they are accessing sites like Facebook and Twitter online. And the limitation to doing that is it's hard to edit a resume from a mobile phone. We don't see a lot of people starting really sophisticated online businesses through mobile technology and I think that that's one thing that, unless changes are made, may hold back African Americans as they get into the internet and access this brand new open space.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: So while mobile devices have expanded access to the Internet, they limit the experience on the Internet for African Americans?</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: When it comes to doing sophisticated activities like creating the next Facebook, that's where I want people of color to go. And mobile phones really don't do that at this point.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Where do you go then if what you can afford is a mobile phone, but what you need is a laptop?</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: So I think being a little bit smarter and making a better choice and getting a netbook or even the new tablet, you know, craze, the iPad, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, we're seeing low-powered ways to get computing power that I think need to be leveraged by people of color.</p>
