<h1> "100 Years Later, 1911 Health Problems Still Relevant" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>The Lancet's executive editor is Dr. Bill Summerskill. Among the concerns he found in the New Year's edition from a hundred years ago: cancer, tuberculosis and health care for those who couldn't afford it.</p>
    <p>BILL SUMMERSKILL: So there were great concerns amongst those who cared for people what was going to happen to less advantaged people as situations worsened. So that started out by ringing a real bell with me, because those are topics that we worry about today.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: There's another issue that shows up in the journal itself, and it's a concern that is still with us. And that is the correspondent from New York reporting on a crackdown on trade in rotten eggs. So food safety was on their mind.</p>
    <p>SUMMERSKILL: And I think you can't help but read that and rejoice at the recent passage through Congress of the new food safety legislation.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Was there one thing in this editorial or this issue that brought into stark relief for you how far we've come?</p>
    <p>SUMMERSKILL: And I think a specific example was in 1909, I believe, Paul Ehrlich had introduced Salvarsan, which was the first specific treatment for syphilis. And this marked the dawn of the anti-microbial era. So we see a number of pieces in here about the remarkable treatment effects of Salvarsan on syphilis.</p>
    <p>HIV: You know, I didn't realize that there was a time when we regarded HIV as such an incurable problem.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Dr. Summerskill, thank you very much for joining us.</p>
    <p>SUMMERSKILL: Thank you, Renee.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Bill Summerskill is the executive editor of the medical journal the Lancet. He joined us from the journal's office in London.</p>
