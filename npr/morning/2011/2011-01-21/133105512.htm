    <p>And our last word in business today is the demise of the DVD. It wasn't so long ago, just a few years, that a character in the TV series "The Sopranos" took to hanging around the main character's house. He seemed excited by their great DVD player. Now the company that ships DVD's to your house is looking to a future beyond DVD's. </p>

    <p>That would be Netflix. It announced a change to its online business this week. That change makes it a bit harder for people who stream movies to also order physical discs to their homes. Unhappy customers accused Netflix of trying to kill off DVD subscriptions. </p>
    <p>Spokesman Steve Swasey said no, not the case. </p>
    <p>Mr. STEVE SWASEY (Vice President of Corporate Communications, Netflix): The objective is to keep the streaming as simple and as focused on streaming as possible. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: But the fact is Netflix is planning to get rid of DVDs. The question is when? </p>
    <p>Mr. SWASEY: We haven't said exactly when we forecast the demise of DVD. We think we'll be shipping DVDs for several more years. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Several more years, but not forever. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
