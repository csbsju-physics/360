    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>Boy Scouts are no longer just tying knots or helping old people across the street. Now they're working as traffic cops. The Daily Mail reports members of one troop in England earned badges for helping officers catch speeding drivers. The 10 to 14-year-olds first learned to use laser speed guns, then they stopped two dozen motorists. Violators were given the option of a fine or a warning by the scouts. They all chose the warning. </p>
