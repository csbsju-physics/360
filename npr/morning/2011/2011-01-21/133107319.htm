<h1> "Los Angeles Tops List Of Rudest Cities" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep, with congratulations to Los Angeles. It may be America's second largest city, but it's number one for rudeness. </p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE: What? </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That's, Renee's city. You're very polite. But Travel and Leisureï¿½magazine says L.A. is even more rude than New York. Apparently, you talking to me is less rude than we simply must do lunch sometime. Washington is only the fifth most rude city in America, although it's not clear if that includes Congress. </p>
    <p>You are listening to MORNING EDITION. </p>
