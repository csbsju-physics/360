<h1> "'Green Hornet' Lacks Sting" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>"The Green Hornet" goes on display in theaters this week, and our critic Kenneth Turan has this review.</p>
    <p>KENNETH TURAN: The Hornet is technically not a superhero at all. Like Batman, The Hornet fights crime from behind a mask with just his ordinary human powers - plus some nifty inventions.</p>

    <p>JAY CHOU: (as Kato) We'll need a car.</p>
    <p>SETH ROGEN: (as Britt Reid/The Green Hornet) Hells, yes. We'll need a car.</p>
    <p>CHOU: (as Kato) With some weapons.</p>
    <p>ROGEN: (as Britt Reid/The Green Hornet) Hmm.</p>
    <p>CHOU: (as Kato) And armor.</p>
    <p>ROGEN: (as Britt Reid/The Green Hornet) Cool rims. Spinning rims.</p>
    <p>CHOU: (as Kato) I can do that.</p>
    <p>ROGEN: (as Britt Reid/The Green Hornet) Kato, I want you to take my hand. I want you to come with me on this adventure.</p>
    <p>TURAN: An unexpected death shakes Britt up. He teams with Kato, played by Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou, to form a crime-fighting team that is never quite sure what it's doing.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "THE GREEN HORNET")</p>
    <p>ROGEN: (as Britt Reid/The Green Hornet) Kato, I think this was the greatest moment in my entire life.</p>
    <p>CHOU: (as Kato) I know. Mine, too.</p>
    <p>TURAN: The performer who looks really lost in these ruins is Cameron Diaz, playing the woman whose affections the boys ineptly battle each other for. Girls are such a bore, the Hornet proclaims at one point - not as much of a bore, however, as a hornet without its sting.</p>
