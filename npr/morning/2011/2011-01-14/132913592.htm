<h1> "Tax Refund Could Go Straight To A Debit Card" </h1>

    <p>Here's Lisa Chow of member station WNYC.</p>
    <p>LISA CHOW: Next week, the Treasury Department will offer 600,000 unbanked Americans a debit card that can receive direct deposits.</p>
    <p>M: I mean, I think the government is doing this to try to get more folks into the banking system.</p>
    <p>CHOW: Chi Chi Wu is an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. She says the program isn't cost-free. Some people will have to pay $4.95 a month for the debit card. But she says that's a lot cheaper than the current options. The challenge will be whether the government's letter will get through to people.</p>
    <p>M: It's not just another piece of junk mail. It's, you know, actually, legitimately from Treasury, and it's something that could save them money.</p>
    <p>CHOW: For NPR News, I'm Lisa Chow in New York.</p>
