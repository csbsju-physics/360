    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep with the story of an artist at sea. </p>
    <p>Nicholas Harrington is 16. His family owned a piano, which was trashed at a holiday party in South Florida. Mr. Harrington and three other people lifted the ruined piano onto a boat. They set up the piano on a sandbar in Biscayne Bay. Fish and Wildlife officials acknowledge the teenager was expressing his artistic side. But the family had to remove the piano to avoid criminal charges for dumping. </p>
