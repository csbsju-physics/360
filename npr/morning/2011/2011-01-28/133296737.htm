<h1> "Update: Police Resist As Thousands Protest In Egypt" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Now, here's a story we've been following all morning long: Egyptians have protested in the streets again today. The protests began after midday prayers, which happen on Fridays. </p>
    <p>Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, our correspondent in Cairo, has been out in the crowd. She followed a march of thousands of people heading toward a main square from the mosque where they had prayed. It is believed - although it's difficult to communicate - it's believed that other people were heading toward that same square from other mosques around Cairo. </p>
    <p>We're keeping a close watch on this story. We'll bring you updates throughout the morning as police resist the protesters who are protesting the rule of Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. </p>
