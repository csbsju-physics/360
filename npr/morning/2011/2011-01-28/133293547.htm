<h1> "Museums Wage Masterpieces On Super Bowl Win" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business is about a bet on the Super Bowl, which will be played a week from Sunday when the Green Bay Packers face the Pittsburgh Steelers. Whoever wins won't just get Super Bowl rings, they'll get prized artwork. </p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Art museums in Pittsburgh and Milwaukee, Wisconsin are wagering masterpieces on the game. If the Steelers win, the Milwaukee Art Museum says it'll send over one of its treasures: a painting by the French impressionist, Gustave Caillebotte  for a few months. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: If the Packers prevail, the Carnegie Art Museum in Pittsburgh will send a Renoir to Milwaukee for a temporary loan. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Now, its not the first time that museums have anteed art in the run-up to the Super Bowl. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Last year, art and football fans in New Orleans were able to gloat over a prized painting from Indianapolis, after the Saints beat the Colts. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: But I don't think it's really betting if it's a temporary loan of the painting, that's not serious. If you want to be serious about this bet, the artwork  you win or lose the artwork with your team if you believe in it. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: OK, even if it costs you millions and millions of dollars. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Whatever, it's a game, it's a game. Thats the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
