    <p>Now, I was taught patience is a virtue. Actually, my mom tried to drive home that point since I've never had much of it. But even I can feel the shift. My 12-minute Metro ride to work used to feel like a welcome time-out. These days, I catch myself irritated at this unproductive chunk of time. Why can't I order new pants through my Blackberry from an underground tunnel?</p>
    <p>C: Then again, it has occurred to me this little device could be a wonderful travel companion, something that keeps his sanity - and mine - at the airport, on a plane, in a long line for Dumbo the Flying Elephant. Though I guess if we go back to Disney, I won't have to remember the handheld. For better or worse, they'll have us covered.</p>
