    <p>The six people killed on Saturday include Dorwin Stoddard, a retired construction worker. At age 76, he remained active in his church, helping the sick and the homeless. He did that work with his wife. They'd been friends most of their lives, then married in their 60s. When the gunman started shooting, Mr. Stoddard covered his wife to protect her. Stoddard was killed. Mavy Stoddard survived.</p>
