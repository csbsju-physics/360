<h1> "Intern: 'I Ran Toward The Congresswoman'" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>And we're going to hear now from a young man whose quick instincts may have saved Congresswoman Gifford's life. Daniel Hernandez is a junior at the University of Arizona with what he describes as limited training in first aid and triage. Saturday was his fifth day as an intern in Congresswoman Gifford's district office.</p>
    <p>DANIEL HERNANDEZ: So the first thing I did was to pick her up and prop her up against my chest to make sure that she could breathe properly. Once I was sure that she was able to breathe properly and wouldn't asphyxiate, the next thing I did was to apply pressure to her wounds to make sure that we could stem the blood loss.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: He did. She survived. Intern Daniel Hernandez describing his role in helping to save the life of Congresswoman Gifford.</p>
