    <p>REBECCA LINDLAND: Toyota is bringing out their new Prius and alternative body styles are expected as well.</p>
    <p>GLINTON: Rebecca Lindland is the auto analyst and, for our purposes, the critic. She says what you probably won't hear, the bad stuff that happened last year, especially for Toyota.</p>
    <p>LINDLAND: The word recall will not be uttered at their press conference.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>GLINTON: Lindland and other industry watchers are hoping this year's the auto show is kind of a snoozer - just a regular year, especially in terms of sales.</p>
    <p>LINDLAND: So as the economy starts to recover, the industry should start to recover as well. So this year's going to be significantly better and hopefully a little bit more stable than last year.</p>
