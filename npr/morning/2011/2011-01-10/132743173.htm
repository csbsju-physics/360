    <p>Here's NPR's Mike Pesca.</p>
    <p>MIKE PESCA: Unidentified Man #1: Patriots' head coach Bill Belichick has thrown acid in the face of his star quarterback, Tom Brady, apparently out of jealousy that Brady was handsome and loved, while he himself was a hideous monster.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW "THE ONION SPORTSDOME")</p>
    <p>PESCA: Unidentified Man #3. I kill Bud Selig, ex-owner, loves to watch the players get screwed high and low.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF "THE ONION SPORTSDOME")</p>
    <p>PESCA: But the joke isn't wouldn't it be funny to kill Bud Selig or the entire line of the Oakland Raiders, which also is proposed. It's the hyperbolic lack of perspective that characterizes the sports media.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Unidentified Man #4: Our homes, our cars, our Internet access, our showers and whatever's in our fridge. All of it is yours, Albert. The buffet is open.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE ONION SPORTSDOME")</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF A ROADWAY)</p>
    <p>PESCA: The clip was supposedly taken from an outdoor press conference. Did you notice how the mic sounded different from the studio anchor who introduced the clip, and how the public official's mic picked up the sound of traffic?</p>
