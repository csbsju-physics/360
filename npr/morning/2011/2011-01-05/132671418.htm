    <p>INSKEEP: The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at a recent deal between Facebook and Goldman Sachs. That's according to today's Wall Street Journal. Despite some talk of going public, Facebook is still a private company. And because it has fewer than 500 shareholders, it is not required to disclose certain financial information. </p>
    <p>But in the deal reported earlier this week, Goldman Sachs is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in Facebook. The investment bank also plans to create a separate investment vehicle that will allow its top clients to buy stakes in Facebook. </p>
    <p>Regulators are looking at whether this circumvents financial disclosure rules. </p>
