<h1> "Behind Rise Of Xtranormal, A Hilarious DIY Deadpan" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>The YouTube video shot in your bedroom now has a slicker competitor: A homemade computer-animated video, made with something called Xtranormal. </p>
    <p>Nishat Kurwa of Turnstylenews.com tracked down the people who made some of her favorite videos. </p>
    <p>NISHAT KURWA: The video that put Xtranormal on the map has more than 10 million views on YouTube. Two button-nosed, Hello Kitty-like characters of indeterminate species confront each other in a static, pastel scene with a lone cherry tree. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of YouTube video) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #1: If it's not an iPhone, why would I want it? </p>
    <p>KURWA: The video takes a satirical jab at iPhone obsession. One of these beady-eyed creatures is plugging a rival smartphone brand. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of YouTube video) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: Well, it's similar to an iPhone, but has a bigger screen. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #1: I don't care. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: The Internet speeds are around three times faster. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #1: I don't care. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: It can grant up three wishes, even if one of those wishes is for an iPhone </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #1: I don't care. </p>
    <p>KURWA: With Xtranormal, anyone can make a computer animated movie. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of an Xtranormal demo video) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #2: Create a presentation for school. Be the host of a talk show. </p>
    <p>KURWA: You hop on the site and choose a background and a couple of animated actors. To cast the irrational boss or the freaky neighbor, you can pick from Lego people, robots, or a gang of regular folks. A few celebrity characters are on hand for spoofs. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of an Xtranormal demo video) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #2: Be who you want to be. Be you. </p>
    <p>KURWA: You type in the script, add some basic facial expressions and gestures, and publish to the Web. </p>
    <p>And Xtranormal Chief Technology Officer Sylvio Drouin says you could soon find that your video has inspired some competition. </p>
    <p>Mr. SYLVIO DROUIN (Chief Technology Officer, Xtranormal): People tend come to our Web site to make a movie because they've watched another movie. We never invested $1 in marketing. </p>
    <p>KURWA: Often, videos that hit the meme-creation jackpot are bringing gripes before the court of public opinion. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of YouTube video, "Black Marriage Negotiations") </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #2: Sisters, where are all the good black men? I just can't find one. </p>
    <p>KURWA: In this provocative short, called "Black Marriage Negotiations," the characters hash out tensions around black love and dating. A generic-looking black man and woman face off across a boardroom table. The woman rattles off a list of eyebrow-raising expectations, which include... </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of YouTube video, "Black Marriage Negotiations") </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #2: I want someone who earns six-figures. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #3: That's me. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #2: A man who will pay all the bills, yet recognize I'm an independent woman. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #3: What? How can you be independent when someone else pays all of your bills? </p>
    <p>KURWA: Darroll Lawson created the video to extend a conversation that began on his "Philoso-Gs" radio show. He figured animation could take the bite out of a contentious issue. </p>
    <p>Mr. DARROLL LAWSON (Host, "Philoso-Gs"): The pauses, the way he looks at the camera. And him... </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. LAWSON: All of that lends to the comedic timing. </p>
    <p>KURWA: Even when you're writing something that's not really meant to be funny -say, like this story - your video gets a humor boost from the computerized voice. </p>
    <p>An Xtranormal video can be shared more widely than a Facebook status update, requires less commitment than a blog, and packs more visual allure and nuance than a Tweet. The most popular scripts have a formula. There's a wise guy who's the voice of reason and a tone deaf, argumentative partner. </p>
    <p>In this one, a professor levels with a student who's bent on applying to grad school. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of YouTube video) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #3: You will teach 50 kids in one semester, while reading thousands of pages a week, and writing hundreds of pages for your jaded professors who are contemplating suicide daily. You will qualify for food stamps. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Child: I will inspire students to think critically about literature. </p>
    <p>KURWA: Allison Leslie made this video instead of blogging about the frustrations of humanities studies. </p>
    <p>Ms. ALISON LESLIE (Creator, Xtranormal Video): Bloggings can sometimes come across as ranting. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Ms. LESLIE: And in this format, ranting turns into humor in a way that people can consume it in a positive way. </p>
    <p>KURWA: Xtranormal just hit the two million monthly user mark, and adds about 7,000 new creators a day. </p>
