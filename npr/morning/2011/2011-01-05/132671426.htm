    <p>And our last word in business today is location, location, location. </p>
    <p>It's an old saying in real estate, but video rental company Netflix is about to snag some prime property inside many homes. </p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Starting this spring, people who buy a Blu-ray player or Web-enabled television from one of many major brands will find a Netflix button right there on the remote control. Pressing the button launches Netflix software. This would make it easier to pay for movies via that service. </p>
    <p>Presumably, your itchy finger would then give Netflix an advantage over competitors like Amazon or Apple. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Netflix pioneered the business of sending people movies in the mail to save them the trouble of going to the store. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Then Netflix made videos available by computers, saving the trouble of going to the mailbox. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: The new remote is designed to help people save the trouble of going to the computer. </p>
    <p>And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
