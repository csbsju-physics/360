<h1> "Police Kept Busy With Stolen Vehicles, Car Chases" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep, with the stolen car news. A man in Jerome, Idaho walked into the sheriff's office and demanded to be deported. Police said no. So he stole a police car, and now he gets his wish. </p>
    <p>Police in Paris, Tennessee, arrested a drunk driver. No news there, except that she's a 77-year-old grandmother who led them on a chase. And then there's the man in Arlington, Virginia, arrested as he drove away very slowly. He had stolen a golf cart. </p>
    <p>You're listening to MORNING EDITION. </p>
