    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Now let's remember a musician whose instruments conveyed a lot of emotion. Gerry Rafferty died this week at 63. He might have been most famous for the song "Baker Street," including a soaring saxophone solo. But this morning, we'll play a song from the same album called "The Arc." </p>
    <p>Rafferty sings here about beginning a journey and hoping to meet again. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song, "The Arc") </p>
    <p>Mr. GERRY RAFFERTY (Singer, Songwriter): (Singing) And we'll sail out on the water. Yes, we'll feel the sea grow. Yes, we'll meet out on the water, where are all strangers are known. </p>
