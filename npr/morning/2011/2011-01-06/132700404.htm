    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>John Coughlin's wife was having a baby, which was coming too fast. So Coughlin drove his wife toward a Manchester, New Hampshire, hospital at 102 miles per hour. Soon a state trooper was chasing them, so the Coughlins called 9-1-1. They got a message back to the trooper, who then escorted them to the hospital. The baby was born six minutes after arrival. The trooper congratulated Coughlin, then gave him a speeding ticket. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
