<h1> "Spilled Coffee Causes U.S. Flight To Be Diverted" </h1>

    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>A spilled cup of coffee can ruin a shirt or it can force an emergency landing, as it did Monday night on a flight from Chicago to Frankfurt. During a moment of light turbulence, the pilot spilled coffee on some equipment in the cockpit. That caused a malfunction that radio-signaled a hijacking. The crew stopped the false alert, then decided to divert to Toronto anyway, where the 241 passengers spent the night. </p>
