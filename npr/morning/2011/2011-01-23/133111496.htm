<h1> "Selling Loans May Be Better Road For Automakers" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>General Motors and Chrysler came to this year's North American International Auto Show with new models, fresh momentum, and a lot of buzz. More people are buying new cars, and the U.S. auto industry in general seems to be making a comeback. </p>
    <p>But NPR's Sonari Glinton explains that many analysts question whether GM and Chrysler can be profitable in the long run if all they do is sell cars. </p>
    <p>SONARI GLINTON: If you ever bought a car, you know the drill. First, you figure out what car you want, and then you look for a dealer - preferably, one you can trust. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of car commercial) </p>
    <p>GLENN (Bangor Car Care): Hey, everyone, Glenn again from Bangor Car Care, and we're not horsing around. We have over 200 vehicles to choose from... </p>
    <p>GLINTON: Not all car dealers are loud and crazy. Joe Sesi is a dealer. He rarely does commercials. He focuses on long-term relationships. </p>
    <p>Mr. JOE SESI (Car Dealer): My family's had this business for 68 years, and I've been doing it for about 42. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: And to build the relationships, he says you have to focus on all parts of the deal. Sesi sells Ford's Lincoln brand, among others. He says it's best when a car company can also make loans. </p>
    <p>Mr. SESI: If we have the vehicles - the products that serve your need - and we take care of you, and we take care of your financing and you trust us, you have a real business then. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: Here's the thing about the relationship: You may change your car every few years, and only see a dealer a few times, but your ties to the lender? They go on and on. Here's Joe Sesi. </p>
    <p>Mr. SESI: I have customers that may have had 20 or 25 Ford credit accounts -oh, yeah. That's a lot of cars. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: Ford Motor Credit is what industry insiders call a captive finance arm - meaning, its main job is to offer car loans. </p>
    <p>Mr. SESI: When we finance through a captive, the chances of that consumer purchasing another vehicle from us are much greater than when we finance through a third party. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: And that's what you want. </p>
    <p>Mr. SESI: And that's what we want. That's why having a captive is very important to car companies. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: Think of Ford or Toyota as car companies that are also big banks. They make money on all sides of the transaction - they make money lending to customers and dealers. When you're about to pay off your loan, they know it. And they start to send you incentives to buy a new car. That's not true for all the big car companies. </p>
    <p>Mr. GEORGE MAGLIANO (Analyst, IHS Automotive): GM got rid of GMAC, and Chrysler spun off Chrysler Credit. They found that that - it really hurt their sales activity, and put them at a competitive disadvantage. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: George Magliano is an analyst with IHS Automotive. He says when GM and Chrysler lost their finance arms in the economic crisis and bankruptcy, it changed how they do business. </p>
    <p>Mr. MAGLIANO: It limits their ability to be aggressive, especially in lease activity and in going after the subprime or the entry-level consumer. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: Magliano says a car company with an internal bank or captive finance arm has more information. That means it knows more about the risk it takes on customers with less-than-perfect credit. </p>
    <p>Mr. MAGLIANO: Without the ability to control the captive finance companies, chances are these people would not get the car or truck loan. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: Those entry-level customers represent a lot of the business. The analysts say that for General Motors or Chrysler to really make a comeback, they need to get back in the loan business. GM has repeatedly made attempts to buy back at least a part of GMAC - now, Allied Financial. So far, they've been turned down. </p>
    <p>Joe Sesi says GM and Chrysler need to get back those captive finance arms. </p>
    <p>Mr. SESI: What we find is our happiest customers are the ones that finance with the captive - because it's in their best interest to stay engaged, communicate if there's any issues, work them out. And so, they do help us make deals. </p>
    <p>GLINTON: Joe Sesi says in the car business, it's still all about the relationship. </p>
