<h1> "Montana Horse Video Spurs Legal Question" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>A Montana public safety video led to a mystery. The video encouraged people not to drink and drive. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: If you plan to drink, plan to have a friend get you home. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: It featured a horse picking up a guy at a bar. This got people wondering if it's legal to ride a horse while drunk. The Helena police chief says there is, in fact, no law against this. When John Wayne and Clint Eastwood did it in all those movies, it was fine. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
