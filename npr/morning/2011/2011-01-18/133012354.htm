    <p>And today's last word in business is about technology stirring up controversy in Huntington Beach, California. The word is: social shaming. </p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>This seaside town is known for its bars, its surfing and unfortunately, it's high number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. A city councilman there wants to address the problem using the social networking site Facebook. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Councilman Devin Dwyer has proposed posting, on Facebook, the mug shot of anyone arrested more than once for driving while drunk. He initially wanted to post a photo of anybody caught driving under the influence, but scaled back his plan. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Still, he's getting pushback from privacy advocates and local police who don't like the idea of this virtual wall of shame. Some say it won't act as a deterrent. One law professor says it's not really appropriate to shame someone before they've been convicted of something. </p>
