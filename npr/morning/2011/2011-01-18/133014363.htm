<h1> "Sal Esposito Would Be The 'Purrfect' Juror" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>Sal Esposito of Boston was summoned for jury duty last week, even though Sal is a cat. Sal's owner Anna Esposito sent back the form, checking off one official disqualification: Sal can't speak English. She also sent a note from the vet. As she told local news, when they ask him guilty or not guilty, what's he supposed to say? Meow? But she couldn't get the summons scratched. Sal is still expected to appear for jury duty in March. </p>
