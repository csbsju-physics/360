    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>NPR's Neda Ulaby has this remembrance.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DO THE LOCO-MOTION")</p>
    <p>NEDA ULABY: Don Kirshner once told an interviewer: I can't tell you how good my life story is, but the songs will make a great soundtrack.</p>
    <p>LITTLE EVA: (Singing) Everybody is doing a brand new dance now...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ON BROADWAY")</p>
    <p>DRIFTERS: (Singing) They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVING FEELING")</p>
    <p>THE RIGHTEOUS BROTHERS: (Singing) You've lost that loving feeling...</p>
    <p>CYNTHIA WEIL: He really was one of the greatest publishers ever.</p>
    <p>ULABY: That's Cynthia Weil. She co-wrote "You've Lost that Loving Feeling" with her husband Barry Mann. Don Kirshner signed them to his music publishing company when they were in their early 20's.</p>
    <p>WEIL: All of his writers were like a pack of crazy kids who all wanted to talk to him.</p>
    <p>ULABY: Kirshner's writers included Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond. And Cynthia Weil says they'd all camp out in front of his office in the Brill Building to get his attention.</p>
    <p>WEIL: And I remember once chasing after him and getting halfway into men's' room before we both realized where he was and where I was and that I didn't belong there.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SPLISH SPLASH")</p>
    <p>BOBBY DARIN: (Singing) Splish splash, I was taking a bath...</p>
    <p>ULABY: Singer Bobby Darin was Kirshner's ticket into the music industry. They met right after high school and - let's fast-forward to 1959. Bobby Darin is on a famous show that reunited celebrities with people from their pasts. It's "This Is Your Life," and they've hit the point when Darin turned 18.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THIS IS YOUR LIFE")</p>
    <p>RALPH EDWARDS: ...writing songs and you find a songwriting partner and here he is now, now president of Nevins-Kirshner Music Limited from New York City, your best man at his wedding, Donny Kirshner.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>ULABY: The singer and his producer reminisced with the host, Ralph Edwards, about their start trying to write songs.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THIS IS YOUR LIFE")</p>
    <p>EDWARDS: How many, Donny</p>
    <p>DARIN: Well, we wrote about 25, Ralph. And 10 of them were published. None of them were real big hits. They were bombs.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>KIRSHNER: They were probably all bombs.</p>
    <p>ULABY: From that humble beginning, Kirshner built a publishing and recording powerhouse, so successful he sold it in 1961 to Columbia. He became president of one of its music divisions. There, he laid the foundation of a legacy in prefab pop.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SUGAR SUGAR")</p>
    <p>ULABY: It was Kirshner who helped assemble the Monkees and later, the Archies - an animated group on the kids' TV show that sold over six million copies of this.</p>
    <p>THE ARCHIES: Sugar, ah, honey-honey...</p>
    <p>ULABY: Mr. Don Kirshner (Host, "Don Kirshner's Rock Concert"): Canada is stirring musically, and one of the forerunners of action from the north is the boogying group the Guess Who...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "DON KIRSHNER'S ROCK CONCERT")</p>
    <p>ULABY: The New Yorker's music editor Ben Greenman barely remembers Kirshner's two TV shows from the 1970s - "In Concert" and "Rock Concert" - when they were first broadcast. But he says, go to YouTube and you'll thank Kirshner for some of the earliest TV appearances of a ton of great rock bands: Led Zeppelin, Sly and the Family Stone, The Police.</p>
    <p>BEN GREENMAN: There's just no end of it. If you go back and look, it's a little museum of everything that was good.</p>
    <p>KIRSHNER: Displaying high energy and excitement, here they are, New York's own: The Ramones.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p>
