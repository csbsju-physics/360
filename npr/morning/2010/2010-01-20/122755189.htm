    <p>INSKEEP: No less than the chairman of the Fed himself, Ben Bernanke, is calling for a full review of the Fed's $182 billion bailout of AIG. Bernanke sent a letter yesterday to the Government Accountability Office. That's the investigative arm of Congress. And he said he would welcome an investigation into the Fed's decisions and actions in the bailout. This is a conciliatory move, which comes at a key moment for Bernanke. His term as Fed chief is up at the end of the month, and some members of Congress are working to block confirmation for his next term. </p>
