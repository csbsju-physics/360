<h1> "Mystery Visitor Misses Poe's Birthday" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. Im Renee Montagne. Once upon a morning dreary, people waited weak and weary, near the grave of Edgar Allan Poe in Baltimore. Each year someone dressed in black, face obscured by a wide brimmed hat, left a present for Poe's birthday. Rose and some cognac had been left, always before. This week, after more than 60 years, no one came, raising fears that Poes mystery mourner might be seen nevermore. </p>
    <p>Its MORNING EDITION. </p>
