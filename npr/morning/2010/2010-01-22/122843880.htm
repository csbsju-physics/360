    <p>MONTAGNE: Toyota is recalling millions more vehicles again, because of problems with accelerator pedals. It's the second massive recall for Toyota in four months. The last recall was because of accelerator pedals getting stuck under floor mats. This new recall for Camry's and other sedan and truck models involves the gas pedal itself. Toyota says overtime, in some cases, the pedal becomes harder to press down or doesnt return to its normal position. </p>
