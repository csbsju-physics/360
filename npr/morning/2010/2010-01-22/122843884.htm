<h1> "Low Mortgage Rates Fuel Demand For Homes" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Home mortgage rates are falling again. They're back down to historically low levels. </p>
    <p>NPR's Chris Arnold has more. </p>
    <p>CHRIS ARNOLD: The lower rates have the phones ringing again at mortgage broker offices and the number of new loans being written has been rising for the past three weeks. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of radio ad) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: Listen, if youve waited until now, this is your second chance to capitalize on some of the lowest rates in a generation. We can save you a fortune with this deal. It's the biggest no-brainer in the history of Earth. </p>
    <p>ARNOLD: That's a radio ad for the mortgage company Lenox Financial, and that many people actually have been able to refinance their home loans and save hundreds of dollars a month. </p>
    <p>Guy Cecala is the publisher of the Inside Mortgage Finance. </p>
    <p>Mr. GUY CECALA (CEO and publisher, Inside Mortgage Finance): The record low mortgage rates weve seen over the past year aren't over yet. Rates are continuing to bounce around near five percent or even under, and it's a great time to go shopping for a home, particularly with a lot of distressed properties on the market, home prices are down. </p>
    <p>ARNOLD: Still, many Americans can't qualify for those super loans rates. </p>
    <p>Mr. CECALA: Mortgage underwriting is still extremely tight, the tightest weve seen in 20 or 30 years. </p>
    <p>ARNOLD: Cecala says most loans being written lately are for people with an average credit score of around 760. That's a sterling credit score, and he says the people without that kind of credit score are having trouble. And he says a lot of other people dont have enough equity in their house to qualify for the low rates. </p>
