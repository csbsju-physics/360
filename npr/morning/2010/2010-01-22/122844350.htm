    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. Im Renee Montagne. A long-running soap opera has a new home and a new cast member - at least for one episode. After 40 years in New York, ABC's�"All My Children"�has moved to L.A., though in TV land it is still Pine Valley. That brings much-needed jobs to L.A., and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa worked a few hours himself, playing himself for an episode. The mayors at a conference in Pine Valley and runs in to Erica Kane. Shes played by Susan Lucci. </p>
    <p>Its MORNING EDITION. </p>
