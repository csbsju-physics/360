    <p>Good morning. Im Renee Montagne. Travelers going through airport security know better than to joke. Now so does a former screening agent at Philadelphia International. There a young passenger wasnt amused when the TSA agent confronted her with a small plastic bag of white powder. Rebecca Solomon told the Philadelphia Inquirer her mind raced when he demanded: Where did you get it? Turns out it was a prank. A TSA spokesperson says hes now an ex-screening agent. </p>
    <p>Its MORNING EDITION. </p>
