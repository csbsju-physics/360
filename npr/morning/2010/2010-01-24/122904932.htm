<h1> "Who Killed This Puzzle?" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>And joining us is puzzlemaster Will Shortz. Hey, Will. </p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ: Hi, Liane. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Well, if it's near the end of January, then the crossword puzzle tournament can't be far behind, can it? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's right. It's the 33rd American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. It's coming up in four weeks, February 19 to 21 in Brooklyn. And a new feature this year is a puzzler's variety show Sunday morning just before the playoff round. And some of the officials and contestants will be performing music, comedy and other entertainment. So, I just want to mention that to listeners. You can also compete from home. And if you're interested in information, you can get it at CrosswordTournment.com. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: So you're moving the variety show from Saturday night to Sunday morning? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: We have other stuff Saturday night this year. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: It sounds like you're keeping it under wraps. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Well, it's going to be trivia games and extra word games. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Wow. Well, I still remember the crew from Dinner Impossible last year. That was a lot of fun. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That was great. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: That was great. All right, well, let's get to our radio puzzle that we do every week and remind us of the challenge - a difficult one - that you gave us last week. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. It came from Mike Reese, who produces "The Simpsons" and is co-creator of "The Critic." I said: I'm looking for the full name of a well-known TV actress and TV comedienne. The first four letters of the actress' first name are the last four letters of the comedienne's last name. And the first four letters of the comedienne's first name are the last four of the actress' last name. Who are these well known entertainers? </p>
    <p>HANSEN: This was a toughie. Just give us the answer. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: The answer is Teri Hatcher and Cheri Oteri. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Oh goodness. I tell you, you stumped them this week. You stumped them. We only received only, oh, well, just over 350 entries. And from those correct entries we randomly selected our winner, Mike Dill from Dallas, Texas. Hi, Mike. </p>
    <p>Mr. MIKE DILL: Hi, Liane. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: So, how long did it take you to solve this puzzle? </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: It took a couple of days, but seriously, when I was out for a run, maybe half an hour to 45 minutes into it it came to me. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Wow. Do you listen to the show when you're running? </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: No. I get the puzzle online and then I (unintelligible) puzzle is and work on it while I'm physically occupied. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Ah. How long have you been playing? </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: A couple of years. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Okay. What do you do in Dallas? </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: I'm retired. I used to be a lawyer. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Okay. Well then, and a word man, obviously. Are you ready to play? </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: I am. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: I think so. Will, meet Mike. Mike, meet Will. Let's play. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right, Mike. Today's puzzle is called J-R. Every answer is a familiar two-word phrase with the initials J-R. For example, if I said going for a spin in a stolen car, you would say joy ride. Number one is pastry with preserves inside. </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: Jelly roll. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Jelly roll is right. Number two: what married taxpayers usually file with the IRS. </p>

    <p>Mr. DILL: Um, boy. </p>

    <p>SHORTZ: Jordan... </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: Jordan River. </p>

    <p>Mr. DILL: Jealous. </p>

    <p>Mr. DILL: Job requirement. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. Follower of the third U.S. president, a believer in agrarian democracy. </p>

    <p>HANSEN: Oh, just right. Mike Dill, well done. Yeah, gee... </p>
    <p>Mr. DILL: Thank you, Liane. You definitely filled in some for me. </p>
