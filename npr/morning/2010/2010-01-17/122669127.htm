    <p>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross says at least 45,000 people were killed in Haiti's devastating earthquake. Even graver estimates have come from Haitian officials. The country's interior minister says he wouldn't be surprised if the death toll was more than double that. </p>
    <p>For the survivors of the quake, the wait continues for food, water and temporary shelter. But officials say they have made progress moving aid out of the country's small airport and more aid supplies are due to flow in throughout the day. </p>
    <p>From Port-au-Prince, NPR's Carrie Kahn reports. </p>
    <p>CARRIE KAHN: Aid from around the world is making its way into Haiti. Planes from Canada, Nicaragua and even as far as Qatar taxied down the airport's single runway yesterday and lined up on the tarmac to offload water, medical supplies and food. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of airplanes) </p>
    <p>KAHN: Also, two huge Argentine military cargo jets stopped in front of the badly damaged main terminal. Four U.N. trucks pulled up behind the jets and dozens of soldiers quickly began pulling boxes of canned meat out and heaving them up to the flatbeds. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of trucks) </p>
    <p>KAHN: Argentine soldier Dario Lillja threw boxes up to the truck as fast as he could. He worked up quite a sweat. </p>
    <p>Mr. DARIO LILLJA (Soldier, Argentina): (Spanish spoken) </p>
    <p>KAHN: He says Haiti is worth the hard work. He'd do anything for the country. Lillja and his army company have been working here in the U.N. mission since last year. He says it's heartbreaking to watch such suffering and not being able to help. This is the first shipment from Argentina to make it in. </p>
    <p>Mr. LILLJA: (Spanish spoken) </p>
    <p>KAHN: Lillja says he's relieved now that aid is finally flowing. He says it's still not enough. The people deserve so much more. </p>
    <p>Pilot Max Vargas says operations are much smoother. He dropped off a planeload of doctors from the Dominican Republic. </p>
    <p>Mr. MAX VARGAS (Pilot): The Americans, especially the military, they took control of the air traffic system and now it's improved very much here. Much safer. </p>
    <p>KAHN: Conditions at the airport were not without problems. Brazil and France complained that the U.S. military had denied landing permission for a couple of flights. During a quick tour of the airport yesterday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made it clear that they Haitians are in charge. </p>
    <p>Secretary HILLARY CLINTON (State Department): We are here at the invitation of your government to help you. I know of the great resilience and strength of the Haitian people. You have been severely tested, but I believe that Haiti can come back even stronger and better in the future. </p>
    <p>KAHN: Clinton flew in on a C-130 cargo plane full of water and packaged meals for Haitians, along with shampoo, soap and other supplies for staff at the U.S. embassy. She flew back home with 50 Americans. Hundreds more stranded foreigners also made it out of Haiti, including a group of women missionaries from Iowa who waited more than six hours in the hot sun for a flight home. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of cheering) </p>
    <p>Unidentified People: Thank God. Thank you. Thank you. </p>
    <p>KAHN: The women not only praised God, but the U.S. soldiers who handed out ice cold sodas to ease the long wait. By four in the afternoon, 200 Americans, Haitians and other foreigners were climbing into the belly of a huge empty military cargo jet. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: You have one more right here. One more. You have one more right here. </p>
    <p>KAHN: Military personnel directed the passengers onto the floor, where they would sit cross-legged for the three-hour flight back to Miami. Gennie Hess, one of the missionaries from Iowa says she is so glad to be going home. </p>
    <p>Ms. GENNIE HESS (Missionary): Oh, it feels wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Praise God. Sitting down. I've had my Coke. I am on a roll. </p>
    <p>KAHN: She says the first thing she'll do at home is take a long shower. </p>
