<h1> "Man Outruns Obesity After Boss's Ribbing" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Antonio Douglas works as a manager at the Cactus Car Wash in Atlanta. He spoke at StoryCorps with his employer and friend Frank Lynch.</p>
    <p>FRANK LYNCH: When I first met Antonio, he was 270 pounds.</p>
    <p>ANTONIO DOUGLAS: Yeah. I always have been kind of bad eater. If it didn't move, I ate it; and if it moved too slow, I ate it.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Antonio, who's 45 years old, lost some of that weight with the help of surgery and with the help of some teasing from his 70-year-old friend Frank.</p>
    <p>LYNCH: One day, I says, look, Antonio, I'd be really embarrassed if an old guy like me could run faster than you can. He was so anxious to get back at me he challenged me to this race. I says, okay, I'll take you up on that. But I tell you what, this race isn't going to be on this car wash lot. What we need to do is we need to go out and rent a small stadium.</p>
    <p>DOUGLAS: I had on a tank top that represented NAACP and he had one representing his people - the AARP.</p>
    <p>LYNCH: Unfortunately for him, in the first race he was beaten.</p>
    <p>DOUGLAS: I had never ran 100 meters in my life. Wasn't no way I was going to beat him.</p>
    <p>LYNCH: There was only one person in the stadium that was happier than Antonio, and that was me.</p>
    <p>DOUGLAS: Over the years, I think I've learned more from him that any one individual I have met. I don't know where I'd be without him. I just thank God for him.</p>
    <p>LYNCH: I think that Antonio Douglas has been one of the important things in my life. Somebody I've been really proud to be associated with and I love him.</p>
