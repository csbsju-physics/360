    <p>Unidentified Man: There comes a time when you know you got to make a change.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT)</p>
    <p>DUSTIN DWYER: Unidentified Woman #1: Oh, this one's bad: Worst excuse for pizza I've ever had.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT)</p>
    <p>DWYER: Unidentified Woman #3: Totally void of flavor.</p>
    <p>DWYER: If you happened to like the old Domino's, too bad. The new recipe took over nationwide earlier this week. Pizza lover Adam Kuban says it is an improvement. Kuban is founder of the pizza blog SliceNY.com. He says even though he enjoys the tangier sauce and seasoned crust, he's not sure the average customer will care.</p>
    <p>ADAM KUBAN: I don't necessarily know if people are going to reevaluate it and think it's that significant of a difference.</p>
    <p>DWYER: For NPR News, I'm Dustin Dwyer in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
