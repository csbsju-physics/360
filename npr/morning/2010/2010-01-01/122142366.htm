<h1> "Minneapolis Trumpets In The New Year" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Right now we hear from Minneapolis, Minnesota. That's where trumpeter Irvin Mayfield brought his New Orleans-inspired jazz to a crowd at a club called The Dakota.</p>
    <p>IRVIN MAYFIELD: From one end of the Mississippi River to the other, my name is Irvin Mayfield.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)</p>
    <p>MAYFIELD: We're going to bring this New Year in right. Let's make some noise and show them what a real New Year is. Make some noise.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And if it was cold in Minneapolis, Mr. Mayfield was not going to let the radio audience know.</p>
