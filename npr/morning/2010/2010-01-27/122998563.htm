<h1> "Athletes: Don't Orate. Just Tweet Away (Please)" </h1>

    <p>But commentator Frank Deford says he can do without any grand predictions.</p>
    <p>FRANK DEFORD: Worse only than guaranteeing, though, is the absolute penchant that misbehaving athletes have for confessing and apologizing, or at least making a stab at it. For like politicians and movie stars, our sporting role models tend to confess with their fingers crossed behind their backs. The latest in a long line of kinda-sorta confessing came, you will recall, compliments of the lugubrious Mark McGwire, who finally got around to saying he had used performance- enhancing drugs, only he couldn't remember what exactly they were and, of course, he took them only for medicinal purposes and not at all to help him hit home runs.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Ladies and gentlemen, I tee off at noon tomorrow, and I'll be happy to discuss my rounds afterwards. We don't need to hear anything else. But you watch, his handlers will make him apologize and confess. I guarantee it.</p>
