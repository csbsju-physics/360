<h1> "Odds On What Apple's New Tablet Will Be Called" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, Host: </p>
    <p>And all of this speculation prompted The Economist magazine to look at the odds on a critical question - this tablet's name.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>That leads to our last word in business today, iBets. An Irish bookmaker is giving odds on that name.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Most of the possibilities start with the letter I, like the iPod and the iPhone. There are four to five odds that the tablet will be called iSlate.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: iPad is another top possibility, and other good bets include iPaper, iPage, and iRead.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: For some reason, the bookie is not yet offering odds on another possibility: iStrain.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News, I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: And I'm Ari Shapiro.</p>
