<h1> "Tiny Kit Car Could Be Next Big Thing" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>A car at the auto show in Detroit this week has the same seating arrangement as a bicycle built for two. The car is called the Tango. It's only three feet, three inches wide. There is one driver's seat in front and one seat in back. The car is not cheap. George Clooney paid more than $100,000 for his, but as an electric car, it's energy efficient and it ends all debate about which kid gets to ride in the front seat. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
