<h1> "Col. Sanders Statue: Bronze Versus Chicken Poo" </h1>
    <p>DEBORAH AMOS, Host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Deb Amos.</p>
    <p>In the city of Corbin, Kentucky, it's a case of rival statues. Corbin is where Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Sanders opened his first restaurant in the 1930s. City leaders now want a bronze statue to honor this finger-licking good Colonel in downtown Corbin. But animal rights group PETA has proposed a statue, too. Their idea - a statue of the Colonel not in bronze, but rather in chicken droppings.</p>
