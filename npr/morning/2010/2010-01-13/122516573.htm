    <p>AMOS: The Federal Reserve is offering consumers expanded protection when it comes to plastic. New regulations bar credit card companies from raising rates for one year after an account is opened. That's to stop the practice of sudden rate hikes. Credit card companies will also have to give customers more information about fees - and they'll have to consider a consumer's income and ability to pay before approving a new card. It'll make it harder for retailers to give out instant store credit cards. And some lenders have already bumped up rates to get an increase in before the new rules go into effect next month.</p>
