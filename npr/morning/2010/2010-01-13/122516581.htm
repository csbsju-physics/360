    <p>You know, Deb, when I was growing up in Indiana, the winners of big basketball tournaments got a special privilege; they got to cut down the nets. You'd climb up on a ladder; you'd take some scissors up there. People from the winning team would take home a little twist of rope as a memento.</p>
    <p>DEBORAH AMOS, Host: </p>
    <p>Well, if that's the case, Steve, then we shouldn't be surprised by today's last word in business. It involves the Rose Bowl, where Alabama won the college football championship, last week. You too, can own a piece of that victory. A company bought the turf right off the field in Pasadena, California.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: This is a New Jersey firm. They plan to chop it up into three-by-three inch pieces and freeze-dry the bits, encased them in glass and sell them for $100 each. This also reminds of people who bought bits of the Berlin Wall. Supposedly, you could even find out if your bit of turf came from the end zone of touched the cleat of a player during an especially big play.</p>
    <p>And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>AMOS: And I'm Deborah Amos.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Rumble.</p>
