<h1> "Some Food Labels Lie, Students Find" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>High school students Brenda Tan and Matt Cost recently spent four months testing the DNA of food items. They had help from researchers at Rockefeller University and the American Museum of Natural History. </p>
    <p>Mr. MATT COST: I knew that we are going to, you know, be testing everything we could get our hands on, but I had no idea what we would find. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Matt Cost says of the 66 food items they tested, the DNA showed that 11 were mislabeled. Sheep's milk cheese was actually cow's milk. Venison dog treats were beef and the sturgeon caviar was Mississippi paddle fish. </p>
