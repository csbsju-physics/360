<h1> "South Korean Company Goes Retro With Its TV" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Today's last word in business is for those who get stressed out by changing technology. The South Korean company LG is selling a type of television so old that many Americans alive today could hardly remember it.</p>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, Host: </p>
    <p>Instead of a cutting-edge flat screen, this TV looks like it's straight out of the 1960s. LG has a brand new cathode ray tube television. It's nice and bulky in the back, with rabbit ear antennae on top.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And knobs that you actually turn to change the channel and volume. It has a screen that is no fewer than 14 inches across. This TV sells for an old-fashion price of a little over $200, and it even has a button that turns everything to black and white, giving even the newest shows that "I Love Lucy" look.</p>
