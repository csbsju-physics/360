    <p>AMOS: Wal-Mart has pulled some children's jewelry off its shelves. It comes after an investigation by the Associated Press. The investigation found high levels of the metal cadmium in toy jewelry sold at chain stores. Most of the items were made in China.</p>

    <p>Now cadmium is a soft whitish metal that is cheap to use in manufacturing but it's also known to cause cancer. And unlike lead, it is not regulated in toys. The head of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is now promising a crackdown on how the metal is used.</p>
