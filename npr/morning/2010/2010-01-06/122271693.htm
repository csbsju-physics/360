<h1> "Planned Anti-War March Stirs Anger In Britain" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Far-flung wars come home in an emotional way to a small town in Britain. That town is Wootton Bassett. And its become well-known in recent years for its ceremonies honoring troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, its at the center of a dispute. A Muslim group plans to hold demonstrations there protesting civilian deaths in Afghanistan. NPRs Rob Gifford reports. </p>
    <p>ROB GIFFORD: The people of Wootton Bassett, in rural Wiltshire, have seen a lot of grief for a small town. Dozens of coffins have been driven through in recent years. And they and increasingly, others from around the country turn out to salute and pay tribute. So the announcement by Anjem Choudary, of the group called Islam4UK, that he would lead a march there in which fake coffins would be carried representing the civilian casualties in Afghanistan has caused some anger. Choudary says its not meant to be an insult but a reminder. </p>
    <p>Mr. ANJEM CHOUDARY (Islam4UK): We are obviously having a procession. Its in Wootton Bassett. Thats correct. But its not about the people there. Its not against them personally. Rather, its to highlight the real cost of the war in Afghanistan. </p>
    <p>GIFFORD: Choudary was previously head of Al Mahajiroun, a group that was banned by the British government for glorifying terrorism. But many of its members have now appeared again in the organization Islam4UK. Choudary has a history of courting controversy and not always following through with his plans. He admits the planned march in Wootton Bassett would be something of a media stunt. </p>
    <p>Mr. CHOUDARY: The sad reality of the situation is that if I were to hold it somewhere else, it would not have the media attention that it has now. </p>
    <p>GIFFORD: Many people in Wootton Bassett, like former Mayor Chris Wannell, are appalled at the suggestion of such a march. </p>
    <p>Mr. CHRIS WANNELL (Former Wootton Bassett Mayor): I would like to say that we in Wootton Bassett, we dont do what we do for any political reason at all. We do it to respect those people whove given their lives for our freedom, and also to try and help the families in their grieving process. If this man has any decency about him, he will not hold his march through Wootton Bassett. </p>
    <p>GIFFORD: Wannell is not alone; 400,000 people have joined a Facebook protest against the planned march. But perhaps more unusually, its also brought to the forefront several Muslim groups, set up very recently, to speak out against Islamist extremism. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd protests) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Group: Freedom! Democracy! Freedom! Democracy! </p>
    <p>GIFFORD: Perhaps the most striking group to emerge is called British Muslims for Secular Democracy, or BMSD. The groups Web site has clips of a recent protest that gently mocks extremist demonstrators and their slogans. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd protests) </p>
    <p>Ms. TEHMINA KAZI (Director, British Muslims for Secular Democracy): I support an ideology that I want to see take over the world: liberal democracy. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: I have a message for those who insult Islam. Lets agree to disagree. </p>
    <p>GIFFORD: The director of BMSD is Tehmina Kazi, who says the establishment of such groups is a major step forward for the Muslim community, which has tended to circle the wagons when attacked in the past. Kazi says if Islam4UK goes ahead with the protest, British Muslims for Secular Democracy will be there, too. </p>
    <p>Ms. KAZI: Were actually writing a letter to Islam4UK at the moment, asking them to either cancel their demonstration or at the very least, move it to a different location. And failing that, if they do go ahead with their protest anyway, well be out there counter-protesting with the British flag to show that ordinary Muslims do not agree with Islam4UK and will public - happy to publicly oppose them. </p>
    <p>GIFFORD: British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called the plans for the march offensive and disgusting. The Home secretary, Alan Johnson, said he will back any request from police or local government to ban the march. But the president of the Association of Police Officers, Sir Hugh Orde, a former chief constable in Northern Ireland, said people have the right to march. Others might not like it, he said, but thats it. </p>
