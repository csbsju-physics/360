<h1> "'Bigfoot' Says His Rights Were Trampled" </h1>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. Im Madeleine Brand. Jonathan Doyle says the First Amendment protects him and his alter ego, Bigfoot. Last fall, he dressed up as Bigfoot and surprised hikers atop a mountain in a New Hampshire park. Doyle claims it was a bit of performance art - thats all. Call them Philistines, but park rangers were not amused when Doyle did it again, but bigger, with singing and dancing. They kicked him out of the park. Doyle has filed a complaint. He says even Bigfoot has free-speech rights. Its MORNING EDITION. </p>
