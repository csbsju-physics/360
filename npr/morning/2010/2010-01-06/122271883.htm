<h1> "NBC's Andrea Mitchel Gets Most PM Face Time" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep, with congratulations to Andrea Mitchell. </p>
    <p>The NBC News correspondent was on TV's evening news more than any other reporter in the last decade. A news consultant says she logged 2,416 minutes on the air, and all those news reports were in addition to hosting a cable TV show. Mitchell once broadcast that show live from Indonesia in the middle of the night, while traveling with Hillary Clinton and wearing a foot brace. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
