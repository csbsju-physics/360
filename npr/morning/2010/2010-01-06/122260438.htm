<h1> "Nursing Offers A Healthy Employment Future" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Lets turn to another major item on the presidents agenda: job creation. This week in our series "New Jobs For A New Decade," were looking at the future of the employment market. More than 3 million jobs are expected to be created this decade in a single industry: the health-care industry. They range from highly paid surgeons to low-wage caregivers. Nursing is expected to add 600,000 jobs. </p>
    <p>NPRs Tamara Keith reports. </p>
    <p>TAMARA KEITH: Mike Jones wasnt happy. He was working long hours in his dads construction business, but something was missing. So after a long talk on the phone with his brother, Jones made an unlikely career choice. He decided to become a nurse. </p>
    <p>Mr. MIKE JONES (Nursing Student): I enjoy helping people. Ive never been in the medical field before. This is my first time. It's all new for me. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: Has anyone worked on this... </p>
    <p>KEITH: Jones and some classmates at Northern Virginia Community College are sitting around a table, cramming for a test. He is 40 years old, never went to college, and before he worked construction, he worked at United Airlines as a baggage handler. He sees nursing as his ticket to a solid income and a solid career. </p>
    <p>Mr. JONES: I feel secure. You know, theres job security. So Im not worried like with the airline. I was with United Airlines. You know, I was concerned toward the end there, and that's one of the reasons that I quit. I just knew it was going downhill. So I don't feel that with this. </p>
    <p>KEITH: If you're picking a new profession purely based on the numbers, nursing is a pretty sure bet. </p>
    <p>Mr. ROGER MONCARZ (Bureau of Labor Statistics): It's a large occupation. It's a growing occupation, and certainly there will be jobs there in the field over the next decade. </p>
    <p>KEITH: Roger Moncarz does projections for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can get an entry-level registered nurse job with just three years of college. And Moncarz says the median wage for an RN is $62,000, putting it among the highest wage-earning professions. </p>
    <p>Mr. MONCARZ: The fact that the wages are pretty high also sort of separates it from many occupations that would be growing. The median wage for all occupations was about $32,000, so the 62,400 is a decent wage. </p>
    <p>KEITH: And the perks don't stop there. Cindy Glover is the chief nursing officer at Reston Hospital Center, part of the large HCA hospital chain. </p>
    <p>Ms. CINDY GLOVER (Chief Nursing Officer, Reston Hospital Center): You can work any hours you want, I mean particularly if you're a bedside nurse. Our full-times work three 12s a week, and that's not bad, having four days a week off. Now, it's a hard day, but you know, still, that's not bad. </p>
    <p>KEITH: But it's not all roses. There are night shifts and holidays, and then there are the patients. </p>
    <p>Ms. GLOVER: It is a difficult job. It's very, very hard. I mean, people can be difficult healthy. You get them sick? And you know... </p>
    <p>Ms. CHRISTI ROMNEY (ER Nurse): You're the quietest vomiting patient I've ever had. </p>
    <p>KEITH: It's 2 in the afternoon, and ER nurse Christi Romney has a new patient with chest and abdominal pain, and a serious case of alcohol withdrawal. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: I'm sorry. </p>
    <p>Ms. ROMNEY: No, you're fine. Don't apologize. I know you'd rather not be doing this. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: I know you guys are working on it, but I need some pain medication. </p>
    <p>Ms. ROMNEY: Yep. That's what... </p>
    <p>KEITH: The patient is in his late 30s and tells her he'd been drinking all night. It's clear this isn't his first time coming to the ER after drinking too much. </p>
    <p>Ms. ROMNEY: You really see everything, you know? We get drug seekers. We get, like this gentleman, alcoholics  a lot of those. If you can't be compassionate to people of all walks of life, then don't go into nursing. </p>
    <p>KEITH: Romney has a master's degree in public health and in her first career, did international aid work. But she says this hands-on work is incredibly rewarding, even if it means cleaning up after a drunk guy in the middle of the day. </p>
    <p>Ms. ROMNEY: So you said no allergies to medications, correct? </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: No. </p>
    <p>Ms. ROMNEY: I'm going to give you the Fenergan first. That's for nausea. </p>
    <p>KEITH: Nursing isn't the kind of job you do for the money. It's physically and emotionally taxing. Tracy Wergley Graebener is a labor and delivery nurse. </p>
    <p>Ms. TRACY WERGLEY GRAEBENER (Labor and Delivery Nurse): There's nothing glamorous about my job. Not one thing is glamorous about my job. But nobody goes into nursing thinking it's going to be glamorous. It's not. I mean, it's gory and some people would call it gross, but it's just what it is. </p>
    <p>KEITH: Graebener says she tolerates the gross parts because of the rewards. </p>
    <p>Ms. GRAEBENER: Yes, you're a good girl. Good girl. </p>
    <p>KEITH: She's checking the vital signs on a baby girl born just minutes before. The baby is healthy, and Graebener is glowing. This is her first nursing job. Just two years ago, she was working as a pharmaceutical sales rep, making four times the money. But Graebener doesn't miss it at all  not with moments like this. </p>
