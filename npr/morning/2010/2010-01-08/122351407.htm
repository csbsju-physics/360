    <p><em>POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION:  The first name of Geyer is Peter, not Steve. </em></p>
    <p>Good morning. Im Madeleine Brand. A couple in Washington state is filling their home with aluminum cans. They have more than 18,000 in their living room. People around Spokane are donating their empties. The couples goal: 400,000. Andrea Parrish and Steve Geyer want to recycle all those cans and make about $4,000 to pay for their wedding. Nothing extravagant: a potluck, some flowers, and some home-brewed beer in a mug. </p>
    <p>Its MORNING EDITION. </p>
