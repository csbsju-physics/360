<h1> "Nigerians Want Ailing President's Powers Transferred" </h1>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>Nigeria is getting a lot of bad press these days. The suspect in the attempted airline bombing over Detroit is Nigerian. And the country has another problem. Its president hasnt been seen in six weeks. Hes been receiving medical treatment in Saudi Arabia for a heart condition. The Nigerian government says hes doing well but hasnt said when hell return. Hes been gone so long that theres an attempt now to force him from office. NPRs Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports from the capital, Abuja. </p>
    <p>OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON: When Umaru Musa Yar'Adua was campaigning to become president three years ago, his poor health was already an issue. There was concern when he had to rush off for treatment abroad for a recurring kidney problem at the height of the campaign. Yar'Adua was asked then whether he had the energy and strength to lead Africas most populous nation and made light of the matter in this BBC archived recording. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of archived recording) </p>
    <p>President UMARU MUSA YAR'ADUA (Nigeria): It appears that I am a normal person, because I know it is normal people who fall sick. It is abnormal people who go through life without being ill. </p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: Officials say YarAdua is in hospital in Saudi Arabia receiving treatment for heart problems. But Nigerians are asking how Africas top oil exporter with a long history of divisive military rule can afford to be leaderless at such a critical time. There's increasing international attention directed at Nigeria in the midst of the bungled alleged terror bombing in the U.S. by Nigerian Umar Farouk�Abdulmutallab. Back home here in Abuja, everyone seems to have a view about their presidents silence during this crisis. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: We wish him quick recovery. That was a wish that he should hand over to his deputy so that the country can move on. And now we don't know whether hes still alive. </p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: The presidential dilemma has sparked legal challenges in court to try to oblige YarAdua to explain his absence, prove hes still able to govern Nigeria, or hand over to his vice president. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #2: (Foreign language spoken) </p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: A lively session in the federal high court in Abuja this week considered law suits against the government, accusing President YarAdua of breaching the constitution by remaining in power while being unable to govern. </p>
    <p>The legal cases were brought by the Nigerian bar association and prominent human rights lawyer Femi Falana. He said Nigerians were tired of the secrecy surrounding their president. </p>
    <p>Mr. FEMI FALANA (Lawyer): He owes the country some explanation as to state affairs. The attorney general says yes, we are great. He was hospitalized, but hes able to perform the functions of his office. Now, the only way you can resolve that is to have evidence, the medical report, written by a doctor (unintelligible) to interview him in the interests of political stability of the country. </p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: The high court is scheduled to hold hearings Wednesday. Meanwhile, Nigerias foreign minister, Ojo Maduekwe, told the BBC there was no crisis and that the president was still in charge from his hospital bed. </p>
    <p>Mr.�OJO MADUEKWE (Foreign Minister, Nigeria): Those who were around him give us a very optimistic assessment. We are concerned that he gets well soon. </p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: But the perception remains that without strong leadership a dangerous vacuum could lead to more political squabbling and maneuvering in Nigeria. Its just a year till the next presidential election here. And most Nigerians simply want an end to daily power and water shortages and long lines at gas stations. They want their president back home to deliver on these promises. </p>
