<h1> "'Pop' Icon: Bubble Wrap Turns 50" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, host: </p>
    <p>Evolution has brought us many things, and five decades ago it brought us this. Shall we, Steve? </p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Oh please. Let's go. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of bubble wrap popping) </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That's the sound of bubble wrap, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a bang. </p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Bubble wrap's manufacturer, Sealed Air Corporation, celebrates National Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day on the last Monday of every January. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: This year, the company is looking back to the time when two inventors developed this product in a small lab in New Jersey in the late 1950s. </p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: They thought - no joke - they were creating a new kind of wallpaper. Then one of the investors looked out of an airplane window and noticed the way that the clouds seemed to cushion the plane during its descent. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Now, of course, it is packaging as well as one of the favorite toys of my five-year-old. </p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: And it has become a big part of pop culture. On this 50th birthday, we can tell you that more than 250 Facebook pages are dedicated to bubble wrap. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: All right. </p>
