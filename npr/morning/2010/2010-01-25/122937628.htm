<h1> "British Airways Prepares For Strike" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>British Airways is experimenting with creative ways to cut costs, and that provides our Last Word in Business today: Trading places. The air carrier needs to cut more than $100 million dollars in expenses. And at one point, its CEO asked the staff to work for free. You can imagine how that went over. Now, with cabin crew threatening to strike, BA wants to keep going and Bloomberg News reports that the company is training its pilots, baggage handlers and engineers to take over the duties of flight attendants should they walk off the job. So maybe on your next flight to London you could have baggage handlers serving you tea, or perhaps a pilot selling you duty-free perfume. </p>
