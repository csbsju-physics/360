    <p>INSKEEP: Regular Wal-Mart stores still have growing sales, but the giant retailer is cutting more than 11,000 jobs at its Sam's Club warehouse stores. Most of the people losing their positions have been conducting in-store products demonstrations. </p>
    <p>A Wal-Mart spokesperson told the New York Times the layoffs are not a cost-cutting measure, strictly speaking. The company has decided to outsource these jobs in the hope that a separate marketing company will do a better job and boost sales. Sam's Club faces tough competition from Costco. And earlier this month, Wal-Mart announced plans to close 10 Sam's Club stores. </p>
