<h1> "Waiting To See If The Hype Overshadows The iPad" </h1>
    <p>T: Frantic Steve Jobs Stays Up All Night Designing Apple Tablet.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>After supposedly forgetting about the announcement until the last minute, Jobs has described gluing nine iPhones onto a cafeteria tray and calling it Apple's new product.</p>
    <p>: NPR's Laura Sydell samples some of the reaction.</p>
    <p>LAURA SYDELL: Apple CEO Steve Jobs certainly didn't play down all the hype.</p>
    <p>STEVE JOBS: We want to kick off 2010 by introducing a truly magical and revolutionary product today.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Jobs and a team of other presenters went on for over an hour and a half about the virtues of the new iPad. Here are some of the basics. It's got a 9.7- inch touch screen. It's got a big virtual keyboard. The iPad connects to iTunes. iTunes will now have a bookstore, and the iPad is a lovely color eReader. There was no major new technology. It got a big ho-hum from some analysts.</p>
    <p>JAMES MCQUIVEY: The iPad had the opportunity to create a completely new consumer device category and it didn't.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: He has this fantasy: Imagine you are in Paris with the family. You want to send photos to grandma back in New Jersey. McQuivey was hoping grandma could turn on her iPad and - voila, there would be pictures.</p>
    <p>MCQUIVEY: So the people across multiple generations are going to say I want an iPad because it helps connect me to my family and my friends in a way that I can't right now. And this device does it.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Not everyone is quite as disappointed as McQuivey. Gartner analyst Michael McGuire points out no one was terribly excited about the first iPod.</p>
    <p>MICHAEL MCGUIRE: It grew. They iterated it quickly. And I think we might be looking at that same kind of a cycle.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: The first iPads won't hit the market for another two months; however, Apple has released a software development kit so that other companies can create new applications. In that time, McGuire things the right application could make a difference.</p>
    <p>MCGUIRE: You could look at this as the first stake in the ground, if you will, as opposed to, well, it didn't meet all of the hype.</p>
