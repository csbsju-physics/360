    <p>Tonight, "The Simpsons" marks its 20th year with an hour-long special. To be skewered by Homer, Marge, Lisa or even baby Maggie has become a badge of honor. Some of you tech nerds and gadget geeks might remember this message from the mouth of Bart Simpson. </p>

    <p>Ms. NANCY CARTWRIGHT: (as Bart Simpson) You're all losers. You think you're cool because you buy a $500 phone with a picture of a fruit on it? Well, guess what? They cost eight bucks to make and I pee on every one. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: For the past two decades, when a social phenomenon became just a bit too trendy and if there was a trend that became a bit too hip you can bet "The Simpsons" made sharp but good natured fun of it. Here's to the next 20 years. </p>

    <p>Mr. DAN CASTELLANETA: (as Homer Simpson) (Singing) It's been so long now, and it seems that it was only yesterday. Ain't it funny how time slipped away? </p>
