    <p>And Im Renee Montagne. Here are a few snapshots of the Haitian earthquake, as reported by our correspondents throughout this morning. The U.S. military is landing more troops in Haiti. Theyre straining against some of the same problems as civilians: a damaged airport and a closed port. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: NPRs Joanne Silberner is with an emergency medial team today. After a string of delays, they finally set up a field hospital, and doctors are trying to handle broken bones and prevent infections before more people die. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: At the border with the Dominican Republic, one United Nations convoy moves into Haiti each morning, and NPRs Russell Lewis tells us some Haitians are moving out, seeking help across the border. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Also this morning, NPRs Jason Beaubien is reporting from a hospital, where a man who was a patient before the earthquake is now left outside the building, alone. </p>
