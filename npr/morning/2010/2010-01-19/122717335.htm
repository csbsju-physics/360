    <p>Good morning. Im Renee Montagne. Theres the Great Wall of China, the Great Fire Wall of China, and now the Great Chocolate Wall. It's an attraction at the World Chocolate Wonderland trade show in Beijing opening later this month. Chocolatiers hope to boost the treat's popularity in China, where its seen as mostly for children. The 33-foot long wall is made of dark chocolate bricks with white chocolate mortar and lined with 560 tiny chocolate replicas of the Terracotta army. </p>
