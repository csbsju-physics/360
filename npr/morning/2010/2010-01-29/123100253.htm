    <p>Good morning. I'm Ari Shapiro.</p>
    <p>It's opening day for the World Chocolate Wonderland in Beijing, China's first chocolate theme park. The event started with a fashion show. Models walked down the runway wearing chocolate wigs and dresses. One woman was draped in a dragon made of gold chocolate coins. There is a Great Wall of Chocolate. The BBC reports that 500 lucky winners will eat it when the show is over. If you go, dress warmly. The show is temperature-controlled so the exhibits don't melt. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
