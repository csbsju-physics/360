    <p>And today's last word in business is overexposure. It's the story of some workplace trouble caused by a photo posted on the Internet. A high school teacher in Pennsylvania was suspended for 30 days after a picture of her at a strip club was posted on a social networking site. The photo was taken at a bachelorette party.</p>

    <p>She was not the stripper in the photo. Someone else took and posted the picture of the teacher. She was in what school officials call a sexually suggestive pose with a male stripper. The teacher was fully clothed and no kids were present, but according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which ran the story last week, some students saw the photo and notified school officials. The ACLU is looking into the case.</p>
