    <p>Americans have donated hundreds of millions of dollars in relief money to Haiti since the earthquake 11 days ago. Last night, celebrities like George Clooney and Julia Roberts called on the world to give more in a telethon called "Hope for Haiti Now." </p>

    <p>Mr. STEVEN SPIELBERG (Director): Hello, it's Steven Spielberg. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: Hi, Steven Spielberg, that's really cool to talk to you. </p>
    <p>Mr. SPIELBERG: Well, it's cool to talk to you. Can I have your name? </p>
    <p>CORNISH: They answered phones and shared stories from folks on the ground. The event was broadcast from Los Angeles, New York, London and Port-au-Prince and aired on all the major networks and some of the smaller ones too. Alicia Keys was the first performer, followed by many big acts - Taylor Swift, Neil Young and Stevie Wonder. </p>
