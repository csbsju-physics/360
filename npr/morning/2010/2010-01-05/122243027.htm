<h1> "New Year's Eve Pranksters 'Homerize' Statue" </h1>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Madeleine Brand. The town of Dunchurch, England, was looking a bit like the cartoon town of Springfield. Residents awoke one morning to find a statue of a local hero sporting yellow skin and a bald head. The dignified Lord John Scott was transformed into Homer Simpson overnight. It's not clear who the pranksters are but local residents want to find them and congratulate them on the level of detail in the makeover. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
