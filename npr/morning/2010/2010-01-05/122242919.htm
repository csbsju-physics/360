<h1> "Electronic Arts Stands Behind Tiger Woods" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. If your friends forward you jokes by email, you've seen that doctored photo of Tiger Woods - the one where he's standing there, smiling but bruised, next to his wife who holds a golf club. Presumably, Woods will look better in a new online game. Electronic Arts says it will go ahead with a game called "Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online." Unlike other corporations that dropped Woods, EA says he is still one of the greatest athletes in history. You're listening to MORNING EDITION. </p>
