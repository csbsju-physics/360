<h1> "Eat'n Park Frowns On Other Smiling Cookies" </h1>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>A cookie may make you smile, but rarely do cookies smile back at you, which brings us to our last word in business today: happy food causing some angry faces. </p>
    <p>The Eat'n Park restaurant chain in Pennsylvania claims it's the only company that can brighten up cookies with a smiley face that's made of icing. It's owned the trademark for more than 20 years. </p>
    <p>Now, Eat'n Park is suing a Texas company called Crumb Corps for trademark infringement. It says Crumb Corps has no right to sell grinning baked goods, no matter how ubiquitous a smiley face may be. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>I don't think anybody has the right to sell grinning baked goods. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Fewer smiley faces, please. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>BRAND: You're smiling. </p>
    <p>That's the business news from NPR News. I'm Madeleine Brand. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
