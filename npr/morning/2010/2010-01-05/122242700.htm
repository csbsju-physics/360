<h1> "Manufacturing Sector Begins To Rebound" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>NPR's business news starts with a manufacturing recovery. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Or at least the start of one, maybe. Factory owners in the United States, Asia and Europe say there's more demand for their products. That's another indication the recession might be ending. </p>
    <p>Today, the Commerce Department released more evidence of the recovery. Factory orders rose by a reasonably healthy 1.1 percent in November, which marked the seventh increase in eight months. Among the sectors reporting the strongest growth were computer and electronic products. </p>
