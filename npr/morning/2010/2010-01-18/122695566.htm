    <p>Good morning. Im Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Readers of the "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back" will find this news story familiar. In the Dr. Seuss book, the Cat leaves a pink ring around the bathtub. Efforts to clean up that mess only spread the pink to a dress, a bed, and finally the snow outside, which is sort of what happened in Buffalo, New York when a demolition contractor tore down an old business, it sent up a cloud of red food-coloring powder. The snow in one neighborhood really turned pink. </p>
