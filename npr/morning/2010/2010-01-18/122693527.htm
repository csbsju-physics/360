    <p>MONTAGNE: Toyota is planning to ramp up its production of hybrid cars. That's according to a Japanese newspaper report which says the company aims to sell a million hybrid cars in 2011 - double the number it sold last year. </p>
    <p>The report also says the company wants to add 10 new hybrids to its lineup over the next few years. This comes after last week's unveiling of the new FT-CH hybrid at the Detroit Auto Show. It's a sleek sedan that could be priced as low as the mid teens. </p>
