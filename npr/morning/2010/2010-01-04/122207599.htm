<h1> "'Best Job' Winner Stung By Dangerous Jellyfish" </h1>

    <p>Several months ago, our own Renee Montagne brought you this story about possibly the best job in the world. </p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Australian tourism officials have been searching for someone to be their island caretaker - basically, someone who will swim, scuba dive, and explore the islands around the Great Barrier Reef and then - here's the job - blog about it to promote the area. </p>
    <p>BRAND: The blogger would earn more than 100,000 U.S. dollars for six months of this work. No surprise, thousands of people applied, and the winner was Ben Southall. He's a mountaineering, scuba diving, bungee jumping, all-around adventure guy. </p>
    <p>Mr. BEN SOUTHALL (Blogger): As for trying new things, how about riding an ostrich? What can I say - animals love me, and I love them, too. </p>
    <p>BRAND: That boast proved a bit of a stretch. Last week, Southall was stung by a tiny but potentially deadly jellyfish. Fortunately, he made it to a doctor in time, and survived to blog another day. He advised his readers to wear protective gear when swimming in the waters off the Great Barrier Reef. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>BRAND: And that's the business news from MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Madeleine Brand. </p>
