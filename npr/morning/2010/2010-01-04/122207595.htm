    <p>NPR's business news starts with falling temperatures and rising prices. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>BRAND: From the orchards in Florida to the dairy farms in Indiana, orange growers and cows are shivering this morning. A cold wind is blowing across the northern plains and sending a chill down the spine of the East Coast. </p>
    <p>Record lows are helping drive up energy prices. Natural gas and home heating oil prices are rising. Crude oil has started trading above $80 a barrel. All of that likely will translate into higher energy bills. The rising prices also suggest the global economy is recovering, and regaining its appetite for fuel. </p>
