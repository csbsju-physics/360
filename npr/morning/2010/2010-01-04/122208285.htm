<h1> "Goats Enjoy Feast Of Christmas Trees" </h1>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Madeleine Brand. </p>
    <p>There will be fewer Christmas trees waiting for a trip to the landfill this year in Washington state. Residents of Arlington decided to recycle dozens of their trees. And by doing so, they provided a meal for a few dozen local creatures. Used Christmas trees were donated to the New Moon Farm Goat Rescue and Sanctuary, and the goats took care of the rest by turning the trees into a post-holiday feast. </p>
