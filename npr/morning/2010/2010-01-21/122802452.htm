<h1> "Conan O'Brien Reaches Deal To Leave NBC" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Our last word in business today is so long. NBC, this morning, made it official. It announced that after a seven-month stint hosting "The Tonight Show," Conan O'Brien will leave. That opens up the host chair for Jay Leno, whose primetime show was judged a flop. The Wall Street Journal reports the move will cost NBC quite a bit: 32 million in severance for Conan O'Brien and $12 million for his staff. The long and very public drama has made NBC the butt of late-night jokes. Though O'Brien, at least, won't be cracking wise about the network. His agreement with NBC includes a non-disparagement clause. </p>
