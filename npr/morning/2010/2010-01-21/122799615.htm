<h1> "Obama 'The Musical' Opens In Germany" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Now for Washington - the musical. It premiered on a stage in Frankfurt, Germany, this week. Theater-goers were treated to a singing Sarah Palin with go-go dancers, a Hillary Clinton solo, and Barack and Michelle Obama crooning over their budding romance. The production is called Hope. It sets the story of the 2008 election to song and dance. </p>
    <p>Kyle James went to a rehearsal and brings us this report. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: Check one, two. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #2: Check one, two, three, four. </p>
    <p>KYLE JAMES: In a rehearsal space technicians cue music and a group of performers take their positions for the first song of the new Obama musical. The lyrics talk about the concerns of many in America as the 2008 elections approached. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #3: (Singing) (Unintelligible) </p>
    <p>JAMES: One of the shows storylines centers around a fictional group of people living in a Chicago community. Among them there is a Puerto Rican man who has lost his job and his faith in politics, an African-American activist, and a conservative widow who has immigrated from Germany. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #1: Mr. John McCain is the only obvious choice to be the next president. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #4: Oh, God. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. RANDALL HUTCHINS (Writer-Composer): Each person depicts a general circumstance that people found themselves in - jobless, losing their jobs, the homes, losing homes. </p>
    <p>JAMES: Randall Hutchins is an American living in Germany, who wrote the show and composed the music. He said he wanted to show how the Obama campaign was able to inspire a large cross-section of people and restore their faith in the future. </p>
    <p>Mr. HUTCHINS: The movement in the country was - the vibe was incredible, if you remember, you know, it was really a special time. So the inspiration came from that combination. </p>
    <p>JAMES: The musical follows Barack Obamas path from community organizer to American president. Along the way he meets a certain Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, here played by Houston native Della Miles. </p>
    <p>Ms. DELLA MILES (Actor): It shows how they were working together first and how they connected and how it became a relationship. There is a place where you see how they fell in love. </p>
    <p>(Singing) But I feel so unusually shy. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #5: (Singing) (Unintelligible) </p>
    <p>JAMES: The musical features portrayals of a number of top politicians and figures from the election, including a very young looking Hillary Clinton, and Sarah Palin, who both have dance numbers. John McCain has a singing role, as does Jeremiah Wright, the pastor whose fiery rhetoric disrupted the Obama campaign. But center stage, of course, is Barack Obama, himself, and the musical climaxes with a rousing song inspired by the campaign slogan. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song) </p>
    <p>JAMES: Actor Jimmie Wilson, who hails from Detroit, plays the president. </p>
    <p>Mr. JIMMIE WILSON (Actor): Its an honor to portray him. Its an opportunity also in my career because theres a lot of focus on this. Were getting a lot comments online, a lot of negative comments, but we don't listen to that. </p>
    <p>JAMES: Indeed, the musical is taking a beating on the Internet. Comments on blogs and YouTube disparage it as being propaganda, pure cheese, deification or a lot of things you cant really say on the radio. Composer Hutchins denies hes written a musical about Saint Obama, but admits that the presidents falling approval ratings at home had to be taken into account. </p>
    <p>Mr. HUTCHINS: I wanted to initially do it in the U.S. But if I would have, I think it would have been more controversial there. Right now President Obamas popularity is much higher in Europe, so it worked out. </p>
    <p>JAMES: Hes not anticipating a run on Broadway anytime soon. For now, he hopes the show will draw good-sized audiences around Germany. After all, this is the country where 200,000 people turned out when Obama gave a speech in Berlin in 2008. Then, Hutchins says, he's looking toward a possible tour for the show in Africa, where the perils of Washington politics havent dulled the president's shine. </p>
