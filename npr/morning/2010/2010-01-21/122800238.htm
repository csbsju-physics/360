    <p>Good morning. Im Renee Montagne. Researchers think they found the remains of one of the first English princesses. Scientists believe that bones found wrapped in silk in a lead coffin two years ago in a cathedral in Germany are that of Eadgyth. Eadgyth was the sister of Englands first king, who ruled in the 10th century. She was chosen by the first Holy Roman Emperor as his queen, leading one researcher to call Eadgyth the Princess Diana of her day. </p>
