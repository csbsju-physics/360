    <p>MONTAGNE: President Obama says the banks are still operating under the same rules that led to last year's financial meltdown. Speaking this hour at the White House, Mr. Obama said he wants to limit the size of the banks and prohibit them from trading on their own behalf, called proprietary trading. The White House wants Congress to add the proposal to legislation aimed at regulating the financial industry. </p>
