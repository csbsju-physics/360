<h1> "Medical Plane Avoids Collision Over Haiti" </h1>
    <p>DEBORAH AMOS, Host: </p>
    <p>NPR's Joanne Silberner is traveling with medical rescue workers headed to Haiti, but she and they are not there yet. Last night, their plane was in a near-miss above the crowded airport in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. Her plane was diverted and she joins us from another Caribbean island. Good morning.</p>
    <p>JOANNE SILBERNER: Good morning.</p>
    <p>AMOS: Why couldn't you make it in to Haiti?</p>
    <p>SILBERNER: Well, last night, on the approach to the airport, there were too many planes coming in. We got caught in the backwash of another plane, the engine stalled. The pilot managed to pull us out of it. We headed up and away. Then we had some problems with cabin pressure and not a whole lot of fuel to keep on trying these attempts, so we came here.</p>
    <p>AMOS: So, where did you end up?</p>
    <p>SILBERNER: We ended up in Providenciales. And that's an island that's part of the Turks and Caicos.</p>
    <p>AMOS: Who are you with?</p>
    <p>SILBERNER: But I have to tell you that this near-miss did not faze this group. They're looking forward to getting up and going. They're very anxious to get there.</p>
    <p>AMOS: Joanne Silberner, not quite in Haiti yet, and I guess we'll hear more from you once the medical teams and you get to Haiti.</p>
    <p>SILBERNER: Yes.</p>
    <p>AMOS: Thank you.</p>
    <p>SILBERNER: Thank you.</p>
