<h1> "When The Tooth Fairy Overbooks, Helpers Step In" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>It is a Friday morning when we hear from our series, StoryCorps. This project is traveling the country to record people talking about their lives and loved ones. Lisa Ray stepped into a recording booth in Norfolk, Virginia because she wanted to share a particular memory of her father.</p>
    <p>M: You know, that story - I've held onto that all those years because my dad kind of messed up. It was my chance to see him as a human being and it made me really happy that I had that one solid memory. I think every kid needs to see their parents as a human being.</p>
