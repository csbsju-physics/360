<h1> "Oscar Mayer Says Goodbye To Wiener Song" </h1>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "OSCAR MEYER WIENER")</p>
    <p>DEBORAH AMOS, Host: </p>
    <p>Oh, you know that song. You probably even know the words, because it is one of the most famous jingles in advertising. The Oscar Meyer Wiener song debuted in 1963, and according to the company Web site, it's the longest-running commercial jingle still in use. But today, the New York Times reports that Oscar Meyer is setting aside that famous tune.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>AMOS: Yes. It's launching a new, $50 million campaign aimed at promoting all its meat products. The agency handling the Oscar Meyer account says it's trying to stay away from specific products and jingles and wants to extend the joy and exuberance associated with the brand to all the company's meat products, not just hotdogs and bologna.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Deb, let's sing it. Because we can. You know that we can. Give me a tune. Give me a note to start on, here.</p>
    <p>AMOS: (Singing) Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Meyer wiener...</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Oh, darn. We're out of time.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>AMOS: That's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>AMOS: And I'm Deborah Amos.</p>
