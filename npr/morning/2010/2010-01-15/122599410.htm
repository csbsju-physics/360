    <p>AMOS: JPMorgan Chase has emerged from the financial crisis as a clear winner. The bank reports it made more than three-and-a-quarter billion dollars during the last three months of 2009. Those earnings came mainly from trading activity and investment banking. The bank also profited from the rally in stock prices over the last year. As a result, JPMorgan says it's paying employees 18 percent more in salaries, bonuses and benefits than the previous year.</p>
