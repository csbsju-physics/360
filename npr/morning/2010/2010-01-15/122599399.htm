<h1> "Skating Championships May Preview Olympic Team" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Hi, Christine.</p>
    <p>CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Hi, Steve.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Normally, we would focus on women's figure skating. That's the marquee event. But not this time around, if you favor Americans, right?</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Well, that's correct. For the first time since 1964, the odds are that U.S. women will not win a medal at the Olympic Games.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Not even a bronze. Nothing.</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: And what's interesting, Steve, 1964, you might say, well, why then?</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Yeah.</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: But it's pretty sad that the U.S. might not do anything at this Olympics in women's skating, and it will be almost a half a century since that's happened.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: You said there are some very young skaters, so maybe at best, it's a transitional period right now.</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Well, it is. And Rachael Flatt, for example, who's 17 - there's Ashley Wagner, who's 18. There are young skaters who think they can get in there. If they skate clean at the Olympics without any falling, sure they could sneak in for a bronze. But at this point, it's not seen as likely.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: What about the men?</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Well, the men are fascinating. Evan Lysacek is the reigning world champion, and he is favored to win the national title and go into the Olympics as a favorite for a medal, potentially even the gold medal. And if Lysacek were to win the gold, it would be the first time since 1988, Brian Boitano, that an American man wins the gold medal. So that would be a great achievement. And I'm sure you're asking, what about that guy Johnny Weir?</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: I was about to ask that, as a matter of fact, yes.</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Well, Johnny Weir, who - fascinating character. He wore the Russian jacket when he was, you know, representing the U.S. at the 2006 Olympics. Three-time national champ, fell on hard times, fifth place last year. And - but if anything, it's interesting to see him fight for something after having a great run, being very talented in his early 20s. And I think he'll make the U.S. team because he saw what it was like to not have a title, and he missed it.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Is it true that the men, while being very skilled, are taking fewer risks than they were a few years ago?</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Absolutely. Remember, even, what, eight years ago, there was all this talk about the quad, this guy named Tim Goebel, listeners may remember, who actually did three quads in one program, the long program.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Is it a quadruple jump? Is that what it is?</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Now what's happened is the men are actually pulling back the risk/reward. Frankly, the point system is such that you can do a triple axle and then add a triple toe loop, and that's more points than a quad. So figure skating, as one coach told me, Steve, is actually going backwards. And that's unfortunate.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And what do the skaters think about that?</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Well, they're playing it safe because they want to make the Olympic team. And I think that's, as I said, it's unfortunate, because as a sport, I think you want to see people go for the homerun. And now they're kind of going for the single and then trying to steal second.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Christine, thanks very much. Appreciate it.</p>
    <p>BRENNAN: Thank you, Steve.</p>
