<h1> "Mesa Air Hopes To Emerge From Bankruptcy Quickly" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>In Phoenix this week, a regional airline, the Mesa Air Group, filed for bankruptcy. It's the latest bad news for a state that's been slammed by the recession. And we have more this morning from member station KJZZ and reporter Peter O'Dowd.</p>
    <p>PETER O: CEO Jonathan Ornstein says regional business travel has taken a hit.</p>
    <p>JONATHAN ORNSTEIN: There's just more aircraft out there than the current demand justifies, and these aircraft serve communities where business travel is the bulk of the traffic.</p>
    <p>DOWD: Glenn Hammer is the president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce.</p>
    <p>GLENN HAMMER: Unfortunately, for a lot of businesses in Arizona, it's not an isolated example. You know, since the recession began about two years ago, Arizona has lost about 300,000 jobs. We've lost over 10 percent of our entire workforce.</p>
    <p>DOWD: Hammer says Mesa's bankruptcy hurts, but he hopes it presents an opportunity.</p>
    <p>HAMMER: Our hope is that they would emerge healthier and stronger. We just feel this points to the absolute need to create the most business-friendly climate in this state.</p>
