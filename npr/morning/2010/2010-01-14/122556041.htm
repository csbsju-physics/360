    <p>INSKEEP: Millions of Americans need no reminding of this story, because they continue to live in fear of losing their own homes. The company RealtyTrac, which follows foreclosures, said that last year a record 2.8 million properties received a foreclosure notice. The company says that record could be broken this year. It is predicting that more than three million properties could enter some stage of foreclosure in 2010. </p>
