<h1> "Zoo Hippo Swims To Freedom" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep with a tale of a daring escape. Flooding struck a zoo outside the capital of Montenegro. Could've meant trouble for the country's only hippopotamus, except of course that hippos can swim. The two ton animal broke out of her cage and floated right out of the zoo, finding a dry spot a mile away. The zoo manager says the hippo is still at large, but zoo guards are watching her. And local people have been bringing the animal fresh hay. </p>
