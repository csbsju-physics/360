    <p>And our last word in business today involves the ad agency Young & Rubicam. One of its clients is Accenture, a business consulting firm that recently dumped Tiger Woods as its main marketing icon. </p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>The Wall Street Journal reports on Accenture's new global ad campaign which is out this week. Instead of Tiger, it will feature some fish and a few frogs and an elephant on a surfboard to symbolize high-performing companies. And you may notice also that animals are less likely to get involved in scandals. </p>
    <p>That's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
