<h1> "India's Tourist Sites to Accept Only Rupees" </h1>

    <p>We'll travel all the way to India for today's last word in business - and that word is rupee. The operators of Indian tourist sites like the Taj Mahal say they will only accept Indian money now. They have stopped a practice of accepting U.S. dollars because the dollar has lost so much value. It used to be you could pay 15 bucks to visit the Taj. Now you have to change $20 into rupees. </p>
