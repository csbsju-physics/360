<h1> "Sports Fan Wins Couch Potato Competiton" </h1>

    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Football players may perform feats of strength and endurance, but don't forget the people who watch. They include Stan Friedman. He signed up for the Ultimate Couch Potato competition. He had to sit on a recliner watching TV sports. He could order unlimited food and drink but he was not allowed to fall asleep and he got only one break every eight hours. After 29 hours Friedman triumphed when his last competitor made an unscheduled bathroom break. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
