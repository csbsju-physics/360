<h1> "Biden, Dodd Bow Out of Presidential Race" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>The early presidential primary season is the time when most candidates have to say goodbye. Last night, two withdrew - Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Biden. </p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>This was Biden's second run at the White House and in a recent interview he recalled the way that his campaign imploded back in 1987. </p>
    <p>Senator JOE BIDEN (Democrat, Delaware): I didn't deserve to be president just based on the Richter scale of was I tough enough and did I understand the process. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Wait a minute, are you saying the system worked? </p>
    <p>Sen. BIDEN: The system worked. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: In shoving you out… </p>
    <p>Sen. BIDEN: The system worked. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: …before you even got to the election year? </p>
    <p>Sen. BIDEN: In a strange way, it did work. </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Two decades later, Senator Biden is among the most experienced Democrats and he made it into the election year, but only by three days. Last night, Joe Biden told supporters. </p>
    <p>Sen. BIDEN: One of the things I decided when I decided to run, when Jill and the boys and Ashley said, hey, dad, give it a shot. I committed that I would say exactly what I believe. I committed that I would not, in any way, truncate anything I thought needed to be said. And ladies and gentlemen, we've done it. And let me make something clear to you, I ain't going away. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of applause) </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Now Joe Biden returns to his day job as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </p>
