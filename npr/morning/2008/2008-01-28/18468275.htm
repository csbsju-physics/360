    <p>She met her boyfriend online, so maybe it made sense that when she wanted to kill her new boyfriend's wife, Ann Marie Linscott allegedly turned to the Internet again. She lived in Michigan. The intended victim lived in Northern California, so she placed an ad on Craigslist. Amid the apartment listings and personals, her ad called for, quote, "freelance work." Police say respondents were offered money to eradicate the other woman.</p>
