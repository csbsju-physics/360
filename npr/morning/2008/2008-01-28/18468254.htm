    <p>NPR's Elaine Korry reports from one of those high-priced markets, San Francisco.</p>
    <p>ELAINE KORRY: David Crane, an adviser to Governor Schwarzenegger on economic growth, says access to cheaper credit is exactly what California needs.</p>
    <p>M: It's huge; it's really the single largest issue affecting our economy.</p>
    <p>KORRY: According to Crane, this proposed change alone could boost economic growth throughout the state.</p>
    <p>M: Housing pervades everything because to the extent that people can't finance their homes or they're paying more for their credit than they would otherwise pay, they spend less at the local store, the local dry cleaner, or you know, the local restaurant.</p>
