<h1> "Latino Vote Marked by 'Generation Gap'" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Many presidential candidates speak of bringing Americans together, yet their campaigns will seek us out group by group. And this week on MORNING EDITION we'll report on some of the voter groups the candidates want. We begin with a group that is important in tomorrow's Florida primary, a group the candidates often address in Spanish.</p>

    <p>INSKEEP: Welcome to the program.</p>
    <p>M: Thanks for having me.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And we'll mention that you're in Miami, waiting for the Florida primary. Let's talk about Latinos demographically first. How or what are some ways that they are different from the general population?</p>
    <p>M: Folks here in Florida have been subjected to a battery of Spanish-language advertising that focuses on those two issues - the economy and family.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Do Latinos vote as frequently as other Americans do?</p>
    <p>M: No, no, no. Latinos vote less than other Americans, a little higher among those who are firstborn and recently naturalized, and a little lower when you're talking about folks who are second or third generation and U.S.-born.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Which raises the next question. Is this partly because Latinos are younger than the general population?</p>
    <p>M: Clearly, the most defining characteristic of the Latino community in the United States is its youth. And young people across the board generally vote in lower rates than older folks.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Would you lay out for us some differences, demographically speaking, between older Latinos and this vast population of younger Latinos, and what they seem to want out of politics and politicians?</p>
    <p>M: When you're talking 35 and above, if you're Latino and you're a Democrat, the degree of support for Hillary Clinton is overwhelming. It can go above 60 percent. Part of that is name recognition. Part of that is the association by Hispanics with a perception of economic prosperity under the Clinton administration. And lastly, there is a strong sense that among Latino voters, that they're voting for a co-presidency. And that is appealing to that group of voters.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And if there's support for a Republican, it would be under the - it will be among the oldest Latinos, most likely.</p>
    <p>M: And I think this time around, the only candidate who has that same sort of potential for rapport from Latino Republicans of every country of origin would be John McCain, because precisely of his stance on immigration.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Luis Clemens of Candidato USA. Thanks very much.</p>
    <p>M: Thanks for having me.</p>
