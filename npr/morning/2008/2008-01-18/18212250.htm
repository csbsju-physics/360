<h1> "Stolen Boomerang Returned" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Twenty-five years later, a boomerang came back. Those flying blades are used by Australia's aborigines to hunt animals. They're supposed to return to a skilled thrower. And back in 1983 one disappeared from a museum in Australia's northern state of Queensland. Now an American has returned it. The man identified only as Peter included a check. He also sent a note saying he stole the artifact when he was, quote, "younger and dumber." </p>
