<h1> "VIP Fans of Patriots Dither over Game Guests" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Now, a team that was once accused of stealing signals tries to get closer to perfection this weekend. On Sunday, the New England Patriots play for a spot in the Super Bowl and for an unprecedented 18-0-record, and this affects businesses well beyond the sports world. For the corporate bigwigs who have suites at Gillette Stadium outside Boston, deciding who gets to go is a delicate art. </p>
    <p>From member station WBUR, Curt Nickisch reports. </p>
    <p>CURT NICKISCH: Gillette Stadium won't say which companies have suites and Barb Hefner understands why. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARBARA HEFNER (Marketing Consultant): You run the risk of getting a call from a customer or a client asking, you know, I've heard you have a box, gee, how come you've never invited me? </p>
    <p>NICKISCH: Hefner is the founder of a marketing consulting firm here. Her company doesn't have a suite, but her clients do and they've invited her before. Not this weekend, though. </p>
    <p>She says most are being extremely selective, trying to get the most yardage out of their investment without offending anyone. </p>
    <p>Ms. HEFNER: Do you try to court a prospect who's a possibility down the road? Or do you try to cement a relationship with an existing customer? </p>
    <p>NICKISCH: It's a tough call, and to avoid any fumbles one corporate box owner at Gillette has a different game plan. Covidien asked its managers to nominate their best workers. Senior VP Eric Kraus says that's a much bigger score than the old employee of the month parking spot. </p>
    <p>Mr. ERIC KRAUS (Senior Vice President, Covidien): Absolutely. It's a nice benefit. You're not only going and experiencing the game firsthand, but there's a pride factor when you see the Covidien name and logo. </p>
    <p>NICKISCH: Finally, one CEO here has used his company tickets all season long to network, but for Sunday's big game, he's taking his closest business partner - his wife. </p>
