<h1> "Chicago Woman Gets Eight Years for ID Theft" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business today is gotcha, which is appropriate on this morning when the news seems to be about getting ripped off and about identity theft. Because the Chicago police have nabbed a 37-year-old woman for identity theft. </p>
    <p>In this case a mortgage company and a car dealership notified the police of suspicious activity, but not before these two companies had already sold the woman a house and an SUV using the stolen information. So the woman got the car but she won't be driving it anywhere soon because she just got eight years in prison. </p>
    <p>And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. That's our real identity. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
