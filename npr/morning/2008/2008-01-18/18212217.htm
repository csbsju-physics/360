    <p>NPR's business news starts with the latest loss of personal data. </p>
    <p>A computer tape has gone missing and it has the personal information of about 650,000 customers of J.C. Penney and other retailers. GE Money, a unit of General Electric that handles credit card operations for Penney and other retailers, says this loss includes Social Security card numbers for about 150,000 people. </p>
    <p>Since the tape went missing last October, GE Money has been notifying customers and telling them to phone a special call center. It is paying for one year of credit monitoring services for people whose Social Security numbers were on the tape. </p>
