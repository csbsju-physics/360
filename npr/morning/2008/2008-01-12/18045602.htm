<h1> "Maryland Shoe Shine Stand Re-Opens to Fanfare" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, host: </p>
    <p>It's a new era at the Maryland State House after a four-year hiatus due to a -what amounted to a death in the family. The capitol's shoeshine stand is back in business with a new proprietor and a new attitude. </p>
    <p>Joel McCord of member station WYPR has the story. </p>
    <p>JOEL McCORD: The reopening was such a big deal that House Speaker Michael Busch and Senate President Mike Miller drew a gaggle of reporters when they mounted the twin chairs. </p>
    <p>Mr. DINO WRIGHT (Entrepreneur): ...back old times, sit there a number of times. </p>
    <p>McCORD: The stand has been sort of a memorial to Jimmy Chambers who ran it for 50 years. When he died, statehouse officials kept the stand intact and placed a framed copy of Chambers' obituary on one of the chairs. Then delegate Michael Vaughn spotted Donald Dino Wright's shoeshine stand at a Washington hotel last spring and asked him if he was interested in another location. </p>
    <p>Mr. MICHAEL VAUGHN (Maryland State Delegate): I just think that when we're here in session, oftentimes we are meticulously dressed, and part of good grooming is having a good shine on your shoes. </p>
    <p>McCORD: As Wright was setting up this week, he referred to his predecessor as the legendary James Chambers. </p>
    <p>Mr. WRIGHT: I never met him, but I've heard often heard a lot about him and I'm honored to succeed his legacy. </p>
    <p>McCORD: Now, Wright is a far cry from what you might think of as the guy at the shoeshine stand. For one thing, he has a liberal arts degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo and he is immaculately dressed in a pinstriped suit and tie with a coordinated pocket square. </p>
    <p>Mr. WRIGHT: I've always been on a mission to dispel the stereotypes and the way this particular service has been typecast historically over the years. </p>
    <p>McCORD: As a customer mounts the elevated chair, Wright sheds his jacket and leans into his work. </p>
    <p>Mr. WRIGHT: Now, scramble the water on the saddle soap. Take a dabber and a mix with soapy solution here and kind of do that, you know? </p>
    <p>McCORD: And he uses only thin coats of wax before he turns to the brushes. When he's finished, the shoes look as good as if they were new. </p>
    <p>For Maryland lobbyists and lawmakers alike, it's a relief to hear the pop of the polish rag and the swish of the brushes again. </p>
