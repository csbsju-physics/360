<h1> "Defiance Lengthens Woman's Jail Sentence" </h1>

    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Give Judith Law style points for defiance. She pleaded guilty to grand larceny and burglary and received a five-year suspended sentence. Then she violated probation. So the judge reinstated the jail time. But when asked to sign a document in the case, she included a message telling the judge to kiss her rear end. She didn't say exactly that. The judge then added 90 days to her sentence. And an appeals court has now upheld his decision for contempt. </p>
