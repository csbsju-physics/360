    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>A Museum of Laziness is open for one week in Bogota, Colombia. Among its exhibits, a couch in front of a TV, hammocks and various beds. Its curator said the city-sponsored museum is aimed at an intellectual exploration of the idea that laziness is the enemy of work - although many museum-goers appear to be exploring the idea of the couch potato, taking snoozes on the exhibits. </p>
