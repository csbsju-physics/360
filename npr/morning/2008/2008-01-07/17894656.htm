    <p>NPR's business news starts with the coffee wars heating up again. </p>
    <p>In the latest salvo between two giant purveyors of food and drink, McDonald's plans to set up coffee bars in its 14,000 locations this year. The Wall Street Journal is reporting details of the plan, which involves hiring baristas and selling espresso drinks like lattes or McLattes, perhaps, at lower prices than Starbucks.  The companies have been battling for each other's customers. McDonald's has beefed up its coffee offerings. Starbucks now sells breakfast sandwiches. And the coffee shop chain that started as a place for people to relax has even set up drive-thrus at some of its 11,000 locations. </p>
