    <p>Ms. SUZANNE PLESHETTE (Actress): (As Emily) You know, Bob, ever since you took that I.Q. test, you've been sitting acting petulant. </p>
    <p>Mr. BOB NEWHART (Actor): (As himself) What do you mean by that? </p>
    <p>Ms. PLESHETTE: (As Emily) Petulant means suddenly irritated by the trivial. </p>
    <p>Mr. NEWHART: (As himself) Emily, I know what petulant means. You don't have to talk down on me just because I'm not as intelligent as you are. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Ms. PLESHETTE: (As Emily) Bob, you are intelligent. </p>
    <p>Mr. NEWHART: (As himself) Well, maybe I am, Emily, but ever since I found out what our I.Q.'s are, well, I figured it's affecting our marriage. </p>

    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Ms. PLESHETTE: (As Emily) Bob, it is not important. </p>
    <p>Mr. NEWHART: (As himself) Next to perfect is where the husbandz is higher than the wife. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Ms. PLESHETTE: (As Emily) Bob, forget it. </p>
    <p>Mr. NEWHART: (As himself) Third is where the wife is one point higher than the husband. </p>
    <p>Ms. PLESHETTE: (As Emily) Please, Bob. </p>
    <p>Mr. NEWHART: (As himself) And the fourth, which is us which is the worst, is where the wife is 151 and her husband is 129 which is a difference of ah… </p>
