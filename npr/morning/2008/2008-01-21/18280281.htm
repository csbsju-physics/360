<h1> "Couple Signs Over Home to Charity" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Here's an answer to the real estate mess. If you can't sell your house, turn it into a project for charity. Dennis Kelly and Karen Crawford could not sell their house in Big Pool, Maryland. They cut the price. That didn't work. So they consigned it to a charity, which plans to raffle it off. If people buy enough raffle tickets to raise half a million dollars, the charity will buy the house for $390,000 and then give it away to the winner. </p>
