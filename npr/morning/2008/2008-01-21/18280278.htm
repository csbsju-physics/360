<h1> "Most Depressing Day of the Year?" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>If you're feeling down, at least you can say it won't get any worse. If you believe Dr. Cliff Arnall, this third Monday in January is the most depressing day of the year. He says this is when you get billed for your Christmas overspending. And by now it's clear you're failing in your New Year's resolutions. This is, however, a good day for Dr. Arnall, who told NPR last year he was enjoying all the media interest in his theory. </p>
