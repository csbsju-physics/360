<h1> "Letters: Hockey Star, Smiles, Pinkwater, Soros" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, host: </p>
    <p>Time now for your letters. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of typewriter) </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>SIMON: Many letters about our interview two weeks ago with Willie O'Ree, the first black man to play in the National Hockey League. </p>
    <p>Randy Clan(ph) of Sun Valley, Idaho, watched him play toward the end of his career with San Diego Gulls. He still had that incredible burst, and it was always exciting when he broke out across the ice carrying the puck. I'd also forgotten how eloquent and well spoken Mr. O'Ree is. Thank you for bringing back some fond memories. </p>
    <p>Steve Harold(ph) wrote about last week's interview about a study that claims to show that you can hear a smile in someone's voice; they even gave names to certain smiles. He writes: the Duchenne smile was named for Guillaume Duchenne, apparently. And I can't get over what a lucky man he was. If the human race has a higher honor to bestow on its members, I don't know what it is. Just think of Duchenne's fortunate descendants, being able to look at a human face in their happiest moments and say to themselves, ah, there's grandpa. </p>
    <p>Many listeners wrote in to say that they were frustrated when they went to npr.org/books, looking for a link to the Daniel Pinkwater podcast that we've promised. If you want to find that podcast or download full-length books by Daniel Pinkwater for free, you can get there now through our Web site, or directly at Pinkwater.com. </p>
    <p>Finally, this clarification from Richard Tofel, general manager of Pro Publica, the nonprofit investigative journalism group we mentioned on January 5th, during the interview with John Carlisle of the National Legal and Policy Center. </p>
    <p>On your program three weeks ago, in introducing a guest, you indicated that George Soros' Open Society Institute was among the backers of our new nonprofit investigative journalist organization Pro Publica. That is not correct. In fact, there is no connection between either Mr. Soros or his Open Society Institute and Pro Publica. </p>
    <p>Thanks for setting this straight. </p>
