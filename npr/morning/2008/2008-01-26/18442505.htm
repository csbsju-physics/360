<h1> "Six-Year-Old Not Sheepish About Mutton Busting" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, host: </p>
    <p>Mutton busting, as it's called, has been around for a long time. The concept is fairly simple. </p>
    <p>Mr. ASHER KARK: It's where you ride on a sheep. </p>
    <p>SIMON: That's a panicked sheep, by the way. </p>
    <p>Mr. A. KARK: And they see who could stay on for the longest. </p>
    <p>SIMON: The rodeo event is just for small children. Six-year-old Asher Kark, whom you heard from, recently competed in mutton busting at the National Western Stock Show in Denver. </p>
    <p>Zachary Barr went to Asher's home as he started his training. </p>
    <p>ZACHARY BARR: Asher Kark is dealing with a bit of a handicap. He signed up for mutton busting in just two days. But his family lives in Denver and they don't exactly have a ranching background. </p>
    <p>Do you have any sheep here at your house? </p>
    <p>Mr. A. KARK: No. </p>
    <p>BARR: Have you ever ridden on a sheep before? </p>
    <p>Mr. A. KARK: No. </p>
    <p>BARR: But do you know about sheep, really? </p>
    <p>Mr. A. KARK: Hmm, not really. </p>
    <p>BARR: So to get Asher some practice, big brother Jacob regularly pretends to be a wild, bucking sheep. Jacob puts on their father's wool-lined jacket - inside out, of course - then gets down on all fours. Asher climbs on his back and the ride begins. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: One. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of shouting) </p>
    <p>BARR: And with this training, Asher is ready for the rumble. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of mutton busting competition) </p>
    <p>BARR: The Denver Coliseum is packed to the rafters. Moments before the event kicks off, a rodeo staffer helps the children get prepared. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: We're putting on hockey helmets and flak jackets to protect their heads and bodies. </p>
    <p>BARR: Wow, flak jackets. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: Flak jackets. That protects them when they fall in case the sheep steps on them. </p>
    <p>BARR: Once suited up, it's show time. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Announcer: Time for the mutton busting. </p>
    <p>BARR: The children enter and thousands of people turn their attention towards one end of the arena. All the kids stand perfectly still, awaiting their fate. </p>
    <p>The first contestant is thrown off in the blink of an eye, but the second child stays on for a few seconds. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of audience screaming) </p>
    <p>BARR: And then, it's Asher's time. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of applause) </p>
    <p>(Sounbdite of bell) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Announcer: Not so much. </p>
    <p>BARR: It's over very quickly. The rodeo clowns pick up Asher off the ground and he returns to his place in line. He glumly stares straight ahead. </p>
    <p>Eventually, one child is deemed the winner, but all the kids get really tall trophies. Afterwards, Asher explains how real mutton busting differs from riding on top of his brother. </p>
    <p>Mr. A. KARK: So at first, like, it stops together, so it's harder to hold on. </p>
    <p>BARR: Older brother Jacob is nearby, and like most 10-year-olds, he doesn't sugarcoat his opinion. </p>
    <p>Mr. JACOB KARK: I expected a lot more. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: What do you expect? </p>
    <p>Mr. J. KARK: I should rescue him to win. </p>
    <p>BARR: For NPR News, I'm Zachary Barr. </p>
