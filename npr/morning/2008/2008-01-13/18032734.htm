<h1> "Calculated Risks" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>From NPR News, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>And joining us is puzzlemaster Will Shortz. Hi, Will. </p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ: Hi, Liane. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Welcome back from Jamaica. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Thanks a lot. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: How was the wedding? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: The wedding was informal and very nice. I got to go around the island a little bit. We spent a day in Ocho Rios, which I had previously known only from crosswords. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>HANSEN: You finally get to see the place that the word defines, right? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's right. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Glad you're back in New York. So remind us of that challenge you gave us last week. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. I said take the phrase, Yeshiva Center, which is a place of Jewish studies, rearrange these 13 letters to name a classic movie. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: And what movie is it? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Well, before I tell you answer, I wanted to mention an NPR listener's Web site. He made 13 Scrabble tiles with these letters and he formed funny answers with them and then photographed them. And like - answers like Try Heaven's Ice and I've Cheery Ants. And if you do a Web search on puzzle me this plus NPR, you can find it. Anyway, the correct answer is "Seven Year Itch," with Marilyn Monroe. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: You bet - and Tom Ewell. Well, we had over 800 entries from people who solved this puzzle. And our randomly selected winner is Lauren Zentz from Tucson, Arizona. </p>
    <p>Hi, Lauren. </p>
    <p>Ms. LAUREN ZENTZ (Language Expert): Hello, Liane and Will. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Hi. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: What do you there in Tucson? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: I'm in the Department of Language, Reading and Culture, working on my doctorate. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Oh, very nice. Well done. Oh, a language expert. Boy, I think I'm going to able to use you as a team player today, huh? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: I hope so. I hope so. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Well, glad you're with us. Glad you're here to play. Are you ready? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: I'm ready. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: As ready as we'll ever be. Will, meet Laura, and let's play. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right, Laura. And this week's puzzle involves cars. Every answer is a familiar two-word phrase in which the first word starts with C-A and the second word starts with R. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Okay. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: For example, if I gave you the clue basis for computing insurance rates, you would say calculated risk. All right, number one is what a store clerk uses to ring up purchases. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: A cash register. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Good. A trip by a taxi. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Car ride? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: No, a taxi. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Cab ride. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Cab ride, is it. A walk-on part in a movie? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Cameo role? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Uh-huh. Place where they use branding irons? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Cattle ranch. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Cattle ranch is right. The first James Bond book and recent movie remake. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Okay. Don't let - need a little help on that one. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: This one - I'd know. "Casino Royale." </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: "Casino Royale," is it, good. Oriole who's set the record for the most consecutive games played. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: I guess Cal Ripken on that one. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. Dancing fruit in an old TV commercial. An odd word. You're not old enough, Lauren. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: They heard it through the grapevine - any hint. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's it. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Okay, California Raisins. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yeah, you are old enough. Good. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Part of a typewriter that allows you to go from the end of one line to the start of the next. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Yeah. Something return. The… </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Can I help you out? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Yes, you can. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Carriage return. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Carriage return </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Carriage return is it. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: You know, that's going to go out pretty soon with computers. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's another one. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: No one's going to know from typewriters. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Exactly. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Exactly. Try this one. A kind of tube, as in a TV or radio. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Again, we're in the ancient ages. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Gosh. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Any idea? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: I've got the radio part but… </p>
    <p>HANSEN: It's ray, right? Cathode ray? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Oh, cathode ray. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Cathode ray. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Cathode ray is it, good. Mountains in Alberta and British Columbia? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: The Cascade Range up there? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: No, the Cascade Range - it does go there but they change the name when it gets into Canada. I'm looking for a more generic term. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Oh, the Canadian Rockies. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Canadian Rockies, is it. John Steinbeck novel set in Monterey. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Nope, I don't know that one. </p>

    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Okay. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: How about The Beatles label before Apple? Well, I think, you know this… </p>
    <p>HANSEN: You like taking us… </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: You know, that's the - I don't know. I don't know. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Capital Records. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Capital Records is right. How about a division of an army on horseback? </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Cavalry… </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. Division of an army. </p>
    <p>Ms. ZENTZ: Regiment? </p>
