    <p>In the United Arab Emirates today, President Bush addressed the people of the Middle East. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of speech) </p>
    <p>President GEORGE W. BUSH: These lands have seen the rise and fall of great civilizations. And in the 21st century, these lands are once again playing a central role in the human story. Today, your aspirations are threatened by violent extremists who murder the innocent in pursuit of power. These extremists have hijacked the noble religion of Islam, and seek to impose their totalitarian ideology on millions. Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terror. It sends hundreds of millions of dollars to extremists around the world while its own people face repression and economic hardship at home. </p>
