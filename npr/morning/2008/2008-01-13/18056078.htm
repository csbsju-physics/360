<h1> "Republicans Poised for Battle in Michigan Primary" </h1>

    <p>From NPR News, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>Republican political eyes are on Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday. It's mostly a Republican event because the National Democratic Party stripped Michigan of its delegates for trying to hold its primary before Iowa and New Hampshire. The election is a chance for John McCain to build momentum and a possible last ditch effort for Mitt Romney. </p>
    <p>Our political coverage begins with a report from Michigan Radio's Tracy Samilton. </p>
    <p>TRACY SAMILTON: Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the nation by far, so the economy is taking center stage at every campaign stop. </p>
    <p>Here is Michigan native and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in Grand Rapids. </p>
    <p>Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Former Republican Governor, Massachusetts; Presidential Candidate): I've watched with concern as I've seen Michigan go through a one-state recession. That's just not right. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: No. </p>
    <p>Mr. ROMNEY: And we need to have somebody who cares very deeply about this thing, and I do. </p>
    <p>SAMILTON: Michigan is close to a must-win state for Romney who finished second in Iowa and New Hampshire. Arizona Senator John McCain wants a Michigan victory to keep his momentum after the win in New Hampshire. Despite the high stakes, he's still telling it like it is. </p>
    <p>Senator JOHN McCAIN (Republican, Arizona; Presidential Candidate): Some of the jobs that have left the state of Michigan are not coming back. They are not, and I'm sorry to tell you that. But I believe that we can develop a plan to take care of these workers who have lost their jobs. We cannot abandon them, my friends. </p>
    <p>SAMILTON: Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee has moved on to South Carolina after campaigning earnestly here. McCain and Romney will battle it out in Michigan through Monday. </p>
    <p>On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is the only frontrunner on the ballot -another side effect of the controversy over the early primary date. Those who support Barack Obama or John Edwards will have to cast a vote for uncommitted. </p>
