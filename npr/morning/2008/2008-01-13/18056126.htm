<h1> "Full Moon on D.C.'s Metro " </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>If you happened to be on the subway yesterday in New York or Chicago or even Adelaide, Australia, you might have seen something shocking - people stripped to their knickers for the seventh annual No Pants Subway Ride. </p>
    <p>NPR's Allison Keyes tagged along with a group in Washington, D.C. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: (Unintelligible) bottom up across the gallery place. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: (Unintelligible) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: And don't forget to take your pants off. </p>
    <p>ALLISON KEYES: Dozen showed up at Dupont Circle, bound or determined to drop their pants for the cause or no cause at all. </p>
    <p>Gwendolyn Elizabeth(ph) couldn't quite explain why she was stripping down to her boy shorts. </p>
    <p>Ms. GWENDOLYN ELIZABETH: There is no reason. I am pretty much here, just heard about it through friends and now I'm here all of a sudden. </p>
    <p>KEYES: Dean Mason says he didn't know the New York-based Improv Everywhere group started this to bring scenes of chaos and joy to the masses. The grey-haired man says he just likes not wearing any pants. </p>
    <p>Mr. DEAN MASON: I'm a very expressive type of person who is open to nudity in the right situations. </p>
    <p>KEYES: Like the subway? </p>
    <p>At least the flame-haired woman, claiming her name was Anne Doe(ph), had  good reason for standing here in a mini-skirt and cowboy boots, ready to drop trou(ph). She's turning 40 this year and says she felt like doing really stupid stuff. </p>
    <p>Ms. ANNE DOE: I didn't want to have to de-boot and de-pant at the same time, so I figured I'd wear something that would be easy to get off over cowboy boots. </p>
    <p>KEYES: De-booting and de-panting at the same time could be awkward. </p>
    <p>Ms. DOE: In public, yeah. At home, it's fine. I do it all the time. But in public, it could probably be a little embarrassing. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #2: Yeah. It's a great idea. When I say we ban pants worldwide? </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #2: This could be something big. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd chatting) </p>
    <p>KEYES: At least Ayal Damala Okusinde(ph) was fashionable. He matched his purple underwear to his purple undershirt to the purple pin stripes in a suit, and he followed directions: board the train, drop your pants and act nonchalant. </p>
    <p>Mr. AYAL DAMALA OKUSINDE: It's just a regular day for me, you know? I get up. I decide to went - I'm going to work. So that's where I'm going right now. </p>
    <p>KEYES: The nonchalant part wasn't easy with a gaggle of photographers -professional and otherwise - tagging along. The intrepid Dean Mason nearly got left alone in his tighty-whitey's. </p>
    <p>Mr. MASON: Well, I'm having trouble following the group, but I don't want to, like, you know, be by myself doing this. </p>
    <p>KEYES: Nobody got in trouble, and most bemused commuters were simply amused. Erik Tearing(ph) admitted feeling a little sheepish for not joining in. </p>
    <p>Mr. ERIK TEARING: I feel a little guilty just being an observer, but I'm not about to take my pants off. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>KEYES: Chicken? </p>
    <p>Mr. TEARING: I'm in bad need of doing laundry so all of my best underwear isn't available right now. </p>
    <p>KEYES: Wearing my pants, Allison Keyes, NPR News Washington. </p>
