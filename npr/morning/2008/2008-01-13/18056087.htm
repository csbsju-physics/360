    <p>Another story we're following today is a report that U.S. National Intelligence Chief Mike McConnell says waterboarding would be torture if it happened to him. McConnell told the New Yorker magazine that if the government officially decided the technique was torture, there'd be a huge penalty against whoever used it. But the intelligence chief declined for legal reasons to say if waterboarding should be considered torture by the U.S. government. Last month, the House approved a bill that would prevent the CIA from using waterboarding. </p>
