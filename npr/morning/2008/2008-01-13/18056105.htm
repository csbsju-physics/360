<h1> "Investigative Reporter Tackles New Beat" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>NPR's Daniel Zwerdling is known for his hard-hitting and award-winning investigative stories. We decided to give him a break - and let him report on one of his favorite subjects: food. </p>
    <p>DANIEL ZWERDLING: Food was one of my first passions. When I came to NPR many, many, many, many, many years ago, I wrote a lot about farmers and agriculture and the food industry and cooking and chefs. So when I heard that you were having an occasional food segment here on WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY, I thought this would be the place where I could say in baritone tones the sauce was smoking(ph). </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>ZWERDLING: Just kidding, of course. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Coming soon on our food segment, Daniel Zwerdling gets to the bottom of cheese sambouseks. </p>
    <p>This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
