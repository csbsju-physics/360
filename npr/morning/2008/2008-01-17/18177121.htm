<h1> "'Muslim Girl' Magazine Marks One Year in Print" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>Ausma Khan is executive editor. I reached her at her Toronto office and we flipped through a section universal to women's magazine - the fashion sections. Right here, I'm looking at some of these outfits - and these girls, they sure have all these jewelry on and beautiful make-up, and they've got little mini- skirts and kind of shiny things in fashion but the girls have, underneath these outfits, long-sleeved t-shirts, and in the case of a little mini dress, Levi's.</p>
    <p>AUSMA KHAN: That's right. And that's actually one of the areas, I think, that is the biggest challenge for us, but it's also the area that girls are most interested in because we frequently hear it from them that they have a hard time finding clothes that are sufficiently modest and reflect their dignity and self respect. So what we try to do with the fashion section is show things that are very au courant, very trendy - the metalics, the tunics - but put a twist on them so they are more modest and more covering for their things that Muslim girls we feel comfortable buying and wearing and would reflect their dress code.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Well, the range of subjects covered; life in cyberspace, what would life in cyberspace be different from Muslim girl than for a girl who's not Muslims.</p>
    <p>KHAN: It actually wouldn't be that different. And the only thing that we might do a little differently is add some additional content on some Web sites on Islam that would be interesting for girls or for their parents to engage with.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: One issue, out during Ramadan, offered tips like remember to change the ringtone on your cell from a pop tune to a more solemn recitation from the Koran or risk being embarrassed when it goes off during prayers.</p>
    <p>KHAN: Again having fun with it. Acknowledging that Muslim girls are just like their American counterparts, they enjoy popular music, they watch, roughly, the same TV shows but we're saying to girls, think about things that take you back to the Koran or take you back to the principles of Islamic faith. The message that we're trying to promote in Muslim girl is to focus on to her goal, her character, her ideas, her accomplishments.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Have you heard from any Muslims who are unhappy with the magazine?</p>
    <p>KHAN: We treat it really as a non-issue; that it's the personal choice between a girl and God; and it's up to her to make that choice but the reality is that Muslims come from all different backgrounds and different perspectives and approaches to faith. And the point of our magazine is to be as representative, as authentic, and as an inclusive and pluralistic as possible.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Ausma Khan is the editor of Muslim Girl.</p>
