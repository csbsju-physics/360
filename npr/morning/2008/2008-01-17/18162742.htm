<h1> "Lawmakers Clash on Economic Help" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke is set to testify today before lawmakers on that issue, as NPR's Brian Naylor reports.</p>
    <p>BRIAN NAYLOR: Here's House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>
    <p>NANCY PELOSI: Again, it's about confidence. And I think nothing would restore more confidence in the American people than if we could come up with a bipartisan initiative right away that says we are working together.</p>
    <p>NAYLOR: Democrats say a stimulus package could be on the president's desk in as few as 30 days. Pelosi met with Republican House leaders yesterday to present a united front on the urgency of the problem. House Minority Leader John Boehner spoke to reporters afterwards.</p>
    <p>JOHN BOEHNER: There's no question there's a threat to the economy. And so there is an agreement that we will work together to try to bring forward a package that truly is stimulative that will happen quickly, and those conversations are going to continue in the coming days.</p>
    <p>NAYLOR: Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York.</p>
    <p>CHARLES SCHUMER: Direct injections of cash into the economy, through both immediate consumer and government spending, are the shots in the arm needed to ward off a recession. In fact, many economists believe that spending stimuli have a greater immediate effect on the economy than tax cuts.</p>
    <p>NAYLOR: The Joint Economic Committee Schumer chairs heard testimony yesterday from a panel of economists. Former Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers says any stimulus should add up to $75-100 billion and maybe twice that.</p>
    <p>LAWRENCE SUMMERS: Economic cooling is a much greater risk today than economic overheating. There is sufficient weakness in the economy now to justify stimulus legislation that will take effect as rapidly as possible.</p>
    <p>NAYLOR: Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling.</p>
    <p>JEB HENSARLING: Perhaps one thing we agree on in Congress is that a stimulus package is needed. But we think it is more important, those of us on this dais today thinks it's more important to stimulate paychecks than stimulate welfare checks.</p>
