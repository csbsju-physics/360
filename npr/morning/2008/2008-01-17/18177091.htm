<h1> "Florida Bars Allstate from Selling Auto Insurance" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>Florida's top insurance regulator has told Allstate it cannot sell new auto insurance policies in the state. That's to punish Allstate because it refused to comply with an investigation into its property insurance business. Home insurers have been raising rates and dropping customers in Florida. Allstate now has less than 250,000 policies there. But selling car insurance is still lucrative. Allstate has more than a million auto policies in the state, which is why Florida's insurance commissioner wants to, quote, "hit them where it hurts." Allstate says it's surprised at the move.</p>
