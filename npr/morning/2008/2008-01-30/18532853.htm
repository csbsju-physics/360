<h1> "A Chance to Fly Naked" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>A German travel agency begins this week offering flights for vacationers who want to travel naked. The special flight will take nudists to a Baltic Sea resort popular with eastern Germans on a naturalist holiday. Naked Germans won't be wandering through the airport. Clothing is required until the passengers actually are onboard, carry-ons stowed, tray tables up. Once the plane is ready to take off, they can take it off. </p>
    <p>It's Morning Edition. </p>
