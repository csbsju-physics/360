<h1> "Man Responsible for Smoking Caught Lighting Up" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>It didn't take long for Antonio Nunez to run into trouble at work this year. He leads Portugal's food standards agency. He is responsible for a new ban on smoking in many public places, which took effect with the New Year. And at a New Year's party Nunez was seen lighting up in public. The anti-smoking law applies to cafes, restaurants and bars. But the official says he didn't realize it applies to casinos, like the one where he was photographed. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
