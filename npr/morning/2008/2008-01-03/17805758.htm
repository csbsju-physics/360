<h1> "Late-Night Talk Returns, Most Without Writers" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>If you were up a little late last night, you know that late-night talk is back. Jay Leno and David Letterman returned to the airwaves, and they were not shy about the writers' strike, that it kept them in repeats for weeks. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of TV show, "Late Show with David Letterman") </p>
    <p>Mr. DAVID LETTERMAN (Host, "Late Show with David Letterman"): Let me just you bring you up to date. There's a writers' strike going on - the Writers Guild of America. And we were out because of the strike for two months. And I know you're thinking to yourselves at home right now, this crap is written? Yes. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of TV show, "The Tonight Show") </p>
    <p>Mr. JAY LENO (Host, "The Tonight Show"): A Jew, a Christian and a Muslim walk into a bar. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. LENO: The Jew says to the Muslim - see, I have no idea what they say, because there's a writers' strike. We don't know what they say. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: Everywhere we go… </p>
    <p>Unidentified Group: Everywhere we go… </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: …people want to know… </p>
    <p>Unidentified Group: …people want to know… </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: …who we are. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: David Letterman made a deal with the union to allow his writers to come back to work. Leno's return was tougher. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: …we are the union… </p>
    <p>Unidentified Group: …we are the union… </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: …mighty, mighty union. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Group: …mighty, mighty union. </p>
    <p>MANDALIT DEL BARCO: This is Mandalit del Barco. </p>
    <p>Here in Burbank, hundreds of writers picketed outside of Jay Leno's studios before and during the taping of his show. </p>
    <p>Ms. SARAH SINGER (Member and Organizer, Writers Guild of America): You know, I don't blame Jay. You can't blame Jay. It's an impossible situation for all the late-night hosts. They're under a tremendous amount of pressure. </p>
    <p>DEL BARCO: Sarah Singer is an organizer with the Writers Guild of America. </p>
    <p>Ms. SINGER: I blame NBC, Universal and CBS and all the other studios that have refused to come back to the table and bargain. </p>
    <p>DEL BARCO: Outside "The Tonight Show" taping, the writers carried signs that read: Not tonight, dear, and Hey, Huckabee, don't scab me - a reference to Jay Leno's guest, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee who appeared, he said, because no replacement writers were being used. </p>
    <p>But Singer and the other union members were still disappointed. </p>
    <p>Ms. SINGER: I think there's a lot of people that are not going to do what Mike Huckabee did. You know, there's a lot of people that are not comfortable crossing the picket line. So, I think, you know, Letterman will probably get better guests. </p>
    <p>DEL BARCO: Still, many of those in the audience came away as excited as Vicky Hughes(ph), who traveled from Daytona Beach to watch Leno in person. </p>
    <p>Ms. VICKY HUGHES: I don't mean to say that he doesn't need the writers, because he does. And he acknowledged that he supported them. But he didn't need them tonight. But I think that's part of Jay Leno. Before he became real famous, he used to write his own scripts. </p>
    <p>DEL BARCO: Across the country and New York City, David Letterman's audience seemed pleased that his company, Worldwide Pants, was able to strike a deal with the guild to get him back on the air with his writers. </p>
    <p>College student Elizabeth Coat(ph) certainly was happy. </p>
    <p>Ms. ELIZABETH COAT (College Student): He's hilarious. I'm glad to see him back. He's doing better than ever. I missed it. I'm tired of watching the reruns. </p>
    <p>DEL BARCO: The writer's chief negotiator, John Bowman, said the Letterman deal proved the strike doesn't have to go on forever. </p>
    <p>Mr. JOHN BOWMAN (Chief Negotiator, Writers Guild of America): Jay, I understand your pain. You're taking a bullet for the team. You love writers, we understand that. And Dave, knock 'em dead. You made a deal with us in three days, proved it can be done, and maybe the big 7 media companies could follow suit shortly. </p>
