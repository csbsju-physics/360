<h1> "Wisconsin Turns Out for Toilet Bowl Parade" </h1>

    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>The Rose Bowl brings out parade goers popping champagne. Those lining the route of the annual Toilet Bowl parade in Hustisford, Wisconsin make do with a tractor dragging a case of beer and the king and queen ducking rolls of tp. Still, it's a hot ticket. The Toilet Bowl began in the '60s with a pickup game for those looking to sweat off hangovers. This year, one player lost its pants in a tackle and later made the winning touchdown. </p>
