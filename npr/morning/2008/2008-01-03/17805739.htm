<h1> "A High-Tech Coffee Brewer With a Price to Match" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host:  </p>
    <p>Our last word in business goes forward to Seattle and the world of coffee once again. The word is not Starbucks but Clover, which is the name of a small Seattle company that has crafted a new kind of high-tech coffee brewer. If you thought Starbucks is pricey, wait until you've tried the joe flowing out of this machine. It's a handcrafted single-cup brewer which costs $11,000 - not aimed at the average consumer but rather at the super-specialty coffee shop owner, the kind of person who brews extra rare gourmet beans and charges people $6 a cup to drink it, which might help pay for the machine and which also makes Starbucks seem cheap. </p>
