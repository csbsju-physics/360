    <p>This is not the first time Hasbro has gone after an unofficial online version of Scrabble. A few years ago, the company squashed a site called e-Scrabble. So our last word in business comes from Scrabulous fans who are worried their favorite site will suffer the same fate. The word is B-U-Y. Some fans say Hasbro shouldn't shut down Scrabulous. They want the toy company to purchase the site. And one fan suggests hiring the Scrabulous creators to keep it running. </p>
