    <p>NPR's Business News starts with more turbulence for the Dreamliner. </p>
    <p>Boeing is expected to announce more delays for its new 787 aircraft. The Dreamliner is Boeing's biggest investment in commercial aircraft in more than a decade. The company has some 800 orders for the new plane. But production problems have already put Boeing six months behind schedule. Another delay could force the company to pay millions of dollars in penalties to customers, and could frustrate the plans of some big international airlines. </p>
