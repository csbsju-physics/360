<h1> "Pet Insurance Increasingly Popular Work Benefit" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>For our last word in business we bring you the latest in American workplace benefits - pet insurance. It's still rare, but the nation's largest pet insurer says more and more corporations are offering it. Comcast and Home Depot are among the companies which now make available insurance for their employees' dogs, cats and birds. The perk allows companies to appear thoughtful, at no cost to them. That's because pet insurance is still a voluntary benefit. Employees pay for the whole policy. They do get a discount by buying it through the company. </p>
