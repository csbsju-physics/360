<h1> "Wisconsin Moves to Prevent Cold Feet" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>Wisconsin has abolished a law in an effort to prevent cold feet, literally. After enduring a very snowy month of December and a really cold start to 2008, Wisconsin lawmakers lifted its state-wide ban on heated sidewalks, stairs and entrances. The ban was put in place in the 1970s in response to the energy crisis. Those who pushed to get rid of the ban argue that warm sidewalks would also save lots on snow removal and salt. </p>
