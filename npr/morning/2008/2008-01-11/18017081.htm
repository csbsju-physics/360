<h1> "Wedding Guests to Watch Football Game Too" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Years ago, I attended a wedding at the same time as an Indiana University basketball game. People secretly listened to the radio in church. There is nothing secret about it when a Wisconsin couple gets married this weekend. Their long-planned wedding coincides with tomorrow's pro-football playoff between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks. So the happy couple decided to put a TV in the church. People can watch even as the groom kisses the bride. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
