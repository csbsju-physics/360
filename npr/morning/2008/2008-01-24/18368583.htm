<h1> "A Tale of Two Online Games" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business today is Bogglific.  </p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>That's a word.  </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Is now.  </p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Hope you're not planning to use it in Scrabble.  </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That is the other last word in business, by the way - Scrabulous. Bogglific and Scrabulous are online versions of two popular games, Scrabble and Boggle. The toy company Hasbro owns both the original games and it has  ordered the creators of both online versions, one in India, one in New Zeeland, to cease and desist. Bogglific is now gone, though its online creator disagrees that he violated any copyright law. Scrabulous remains online, raising speculation that its creators may have reached a deal with Hasbro. </p>
