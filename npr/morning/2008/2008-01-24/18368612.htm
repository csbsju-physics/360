<h1> "Teen Car Thieves Refuse to Be Iced" </h1>

    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>A group of Canadian teenagers got in trouble for stealing cars. All four of them were ordered to attend a counseling program in Winnipeg, which simply left the problem of how to travel to the counseling session. It was 40 below zero in Winnipeg, too cold to walk, according to the local paper. And that may explain why the four teenagers showed up for the anti-car theft counseling session while driving in a newly stolen car. </p>
