    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>An unlikely suspect showed up at a Sacramento County Sheriff Department's arrest record. Mickey Mouse is listed as a 47-year-old bartender and resident of Anaheim. His aliases are Buzz Lightyear and Donnie Duck. It turns out Mickey's name is used by police trainees learning to use the computer system. It was one of the names they could use without getting in trouble. Try telling that to Minnie. </p>
