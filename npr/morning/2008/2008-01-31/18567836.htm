<h1> "IRS Warns of Tax-Rebate Phone Scams" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Here in the U.S., lawmakers are still debating the economic stimulus package that would give most people tax rebates, and the Hucksters are already there. Our last word in business is stimulus scam.  </p>
    <p>The IRS says identity thieves are using the prospects of a tax rebate to get people to reveal sensitive financial data. In one scam the caller says you can only get a rebate if you provide bank account information for a direct deposit. The IRS says it does not ask for personal information over the phone. So if anyone calls on behalf of Uncle Sam, you could tell them to take a tax hike. </p>
