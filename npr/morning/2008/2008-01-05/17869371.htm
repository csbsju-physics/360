<h1> "Dr. Fang the Dentist and 'Other Funny Names'" </h1>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, Host: </p>
    <p>And he joins us from New York City. Thanks very much for being with us.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>LARRY ASHMEAD: I'm glad to be here.</p>
    <p>SIMON: Who is Bertha Venation?</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: Well, actually, it's the only non-real name in the book. It's a drag queen in London who adopted the name.</p>
    <p>SIMON: You began to take a shine to unusual names from the time you were youngster.</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: Well, my mother's best friends were Bettina Button(ph) and Edith Shortsleeve(ph).</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: And she didn't wear short sleeves.</p>
    <p>SIMON: I don't blame her. It would only expose to ridicule. And you have a whole section on aptly named professionals.</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: I don't know which comes first - the profession or the name. There's a dentist named Dr. Fang. There's a gynecologist named Dr. Ovary(ph). There's another gynecologist called Dr. Cherry(ph), which I thought was funny and most people do, but they don't.</p>
    <p>SIMON: I've turned a page in your book to some of the aptly named professionals. And no particular order, of course, probably the most famous is Simon Rattle, music director of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: That's right.</p>
    <p>SIMON: But there's Hugh Fish(ph) who's an environmental engineer; Johnny Worm(ph) who grows peaches in California; Andrew Inches, a videotape editor in New York City. You have a section here too on people with improbable names who marry each other.</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: Well, that's a big problem because you get sort of hyphenated names and first names that don't go with last names. I called a woman whose married name is Gay Beech(ph) and said, I think it's funny and she said it's spelled B-E-E-C-H. No A.</p>
    <p>SIMON: And Dan Coffee(ph) sends along the recollection that he's niece married a man with a last name Bean.</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: That's right. Coffee Bean.</p>
    <p>SIMON: Yes.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>SIMON: And a Joseph Cotton's(ph) son married a woman named Velvet Satin(ph).</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: And so she became Velvet Satin-Cotton.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>SIMON: Well, Mr. Ashmead, been a pleasure to talk to you.</p>
    <p>ASHMEAD: Well, it's been very nice talking to you.</p>
    <p>SIMON: Go to see her tonight, and hundreds of other funny names of real people. And this is NPR News.</p>
