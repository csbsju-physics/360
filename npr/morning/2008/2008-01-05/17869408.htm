<h1> "Alaskans Purify the Spirit with Steam Baths" </h1>

    <p>From member station KYUK in Bethel, Alaska, Angela Denning-Barnes reports on steam cleaning the Yupii way.</p>
    <p>ANGELA DENNING: They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but are often just many plywood shacks with an old oil drum stove inside that's covered in rocks, with a pail of water nearby and some kind of ladle for pouring.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF STEAM)</p>
    <p>DENNING: There are many variables. For some longtime steamers, getting it hot enough can be tricky.</p>
    <p>MICHELLE GEORGE: You're burning but you don't feel like you're totally burning, like it's not going in because you damage your skin too much. And you should - could just pour coals so the heat could go in.</p>
    <p>DENNING: Michelle George jokes with her friend about it. But the 21- year-old from Nightmute on the Bering Sea coast really likes it hot.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: To me, I want to feel the heat inside, not just on the outside but inside like you're totally...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF GASPING)</p>
    <p>DENNING: The fact that Nightmute doesn't have many trees for firewood doesn't matter. George and her friend, Nelly Igimok(ph), say you can compensate with pallet wood and a few extras.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: Shoes are the best. If you get shoes...</p>
    <p>NELLY IGIMOK: Because there's a rubber inside it.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: Yeah. And those really smooth kinds.</p>
    <p>IGIMOT: Or like old clothes that you don't want to use anymore.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: And you put, like, seal oil and - but it has to be old. It's better if it's old. And with the okuk(ph)...</p>
    <p>IGIMOT: And it's hot.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: ...really hot, it's good. We put lots of shoes, seal oil and the blubber part with wood.</p>
    <p>DENNING: Just how hot a person can stand it can be somewhat competitive. George says the women she steams with always see who can stay in longer, which took her over the limit one time.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: I was just sitting there and then I was, like, please, God, please, God, I'm not going to be first. And then, they'd just kept pouring. And I guess I had passed out. And they told me (unintelligible).</p>
    <p>DENNING: According to these YK Delta residents, dry heat doesn't even compare to a steam. George remembers a disappointing sauna in an Anchorage hotel.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: It says do not pour water. And I was, like, how would the heck are we going to get hot. And we turn the thing on, we waited an hour and later - nothing, like, you're just sitting in there like you're just getting tired and you're like such a waste, like, you just get - feels like you're just dirtier.</p>
    <p>DENNING: The only way to get really clean is in a good hot steam bath, really hot.</p>
    <p>GEORGE: And when you really burn and burn and burn and pour and pour, when you're done, you're like everything's gone and like you have no problem.</p>
