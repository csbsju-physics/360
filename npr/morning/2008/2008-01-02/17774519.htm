    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Michigan's Lake Superior State University offered a list of overused words and phrases. According to the list, surge has been used more than enough. Perfect storm should be history, along with Webinar, or online seminar. Post-9/11 should be banned. And then there is blank is the new blank - like chocolate is the new sex. For example, in this post-9/11 world, a perfect storm of Webinar shows that surge is the new light at the end of the tunnel. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
