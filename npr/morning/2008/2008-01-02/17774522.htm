<h1> "Snake Births Ring in New Year at Boston Aquarium" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>The babies ringing in the New Year in Boston turned out to be snakes; 14 in all for proud anaconda momma Ashley of the New England Aquarium. All the little snake babies measured two feet at birth - tiny compared to their 16-foot-long mother. It's a rare birth. Scientists say it's difficult for anacondas to breed in captivity. Of course it might be difficult to tell whether an anaconda is pregnant or just had lunch. </p>
