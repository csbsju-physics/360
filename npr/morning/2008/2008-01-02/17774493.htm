    <p>For our last word in business, we take a final look back to one of the most intoxicating workplace related stories of 2007. The word is beer. And the story comes from the Four Points hotel chain, which is part of Sheraton Hotels. </p>
    <p>Last year, the company announced it was looking for a CBO that would be chief beer officer, for its new worldwide beer program. The part-time job attracted more than 5,000 applications from 31 countries. More than 90 percent of the applicants were men. Reportedly, it's the most applications the hotel chain received for any position. </p>
