<h1> "Iowa Mayor Reflects on Presidential Race" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Okay, so the presidential election may not matter as much for some voters living along Interstate 10. But here is someone living where it does matter. </p>
    <p>Mayor LARRY MILLESON (Colo, Iowa): It is extremely cold right now in Colo. It's like five degrees out. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That's Larry Milleson, who lives in Colo, Iowa, a community of about 850 people. Despite its small size, Colo residents have had the opportunity to see half a dozen presidential candidates appearing nearby. </p>
    <p>Mayor MILLESON: I notice a small percentage of the community that is involved. I wish there were more. You're bombarded with advertisement on radio and television. And I hear people telling me they'll be glad when the commercials are over. And that seems sad to me, when people only think about when it will be over instead of the issues. </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: It will be over tomorrow night, which is when the Iowa caucuses are held, the first state to make presidential selections in the nation in 2008. Larry Milleson says people's ambivalence may be changing; at least he hopes so because he was just elected mayor of Colo, Iowa, in a tightly contested race. He won by just three votes. </p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>And tomorrow we'll hit the road again to hear from potential voters at the eastern end of Interstate 10, ending our journey in Florida. </p>
    <p>And you are listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. </p>
