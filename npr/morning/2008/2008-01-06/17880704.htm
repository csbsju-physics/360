    <p>From NPR News, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>Republican and Democratic presidential candidates squared off in New Hampshire last night. Here are some of the voices during the back-to-back debate. </p>
    <p>Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Former Republican Governor, Massachusetts; Republican Presidential Candidate): In the private sector, for 25 years, I brought change at company after company. In the Olympics - it was in trouble - I brought change. In Massachusetts I brought change. I have done it. I have changed things, and that experience is what America is looking for. </p>
    <p>Senator JOHN McCAIN (Republican, Arizona; Republican Presidential Candidate): I just want to say to Governor Romney, we disagree on a lot of issues, but I agree, you are the candidate of change. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. MIKE HUCKABEE (Former Republican Governor, Arkansas; Republican Presidential Candidate): The primary purpose of a government is to recognize that those rights did not come from government, they came from God, they're to be protected and then defined as the right to a life; the right to liberty, our freedom to live our lives like we want to live them without government telling us how to do it. </p>
    <p>Mr. JOHN EDWARDS (Former Democratic Senator, North Carolina; Democratic Presidential Candidate): But these entrenched, moneyed interests that have a stranglehold on the middle class, that are doing - incredibly destructive to American jobs and the health care system, energy, all taxes, trade, there in everything. I have been in the trenches fighting them for - on my whole adult life. And it takes strength, backbone, fight, and you have to take them on. </p>
    <p>Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York; Democratic Presidential Candidate): What we need is somebody who can deliver change. And we don't need to be raising the false hopes of our country about what can be delivered. The best way to know what change I will produce is to look at the changes that I've already made. </p>
    <p>Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Democratic Presidential Candidate): When the American people are the determined that something is going to happen, then it happens. And if they are disaffected and cynical and fearful and told that it can't be done, then it doesn't. I'm running for president because I want to tell them, yes, we can. And that's why I think they're responding in such large numbers. </p>
