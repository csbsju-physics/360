    <p>Unidentified Man #1 (Actor): (As The Lone Ranger) Hi-yo Silver. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #2 (Actress): (As character) I really don't know why you're here Mr. Grant. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: This week, NPR begins a new series called In Character. For the next six months we'll put these characters on the couch, explore their origins, their effect on the culture at large; find out what makes them tick and why they've endured. </p>
    <p>In the studio with us is Elizabeth Blair, she's the curator of In Character. </p>
    <p>Elizabeth, first, a little bit of background. What is this series going to be? </p>
    <p>ELIZABETH BLAIR: It is going to be a series where every segment we'll, as you said, put a fictional character on the couch. We'll find out a little bit more about what the vision for this character was and get at that thing that sort of universal that either it's a character that we recognize ourselves in that character or it's a character where we recognize something about the social climate of the day, something about a particular generation. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Who are some of the characters? </p>
    <p>Ms. BLAIR: We have Atticus Finch, Ugly Betty, Scarlett O'Hara, Darth Vader, Jim from Huck Finn and Pollyanna. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: And I understand you're also going to be soliciting nominations from listeners? </p>
    <p>Ms. BLAIR: Yes. On our Web site, we'll be asking listeners to come up with their own fictional characters and to write a 100- to 150-word essay on why they think this character is important. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Mm-hmm. And then what happens? </p>
    <p>Ms. BLAIR: It is possible that we will do a radio piece if several listeners nominate the same character. We will also be posting the best essays on the Web site. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Okay. Elizabeth Blair is the curator of the In Character series. </p>
