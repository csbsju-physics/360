<h1> "Food Trends for 2008" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSE, host: </p>
    <p>During the coming year, we will be broadcasting other segments about food featuring both top chefs and home cooks. We're going to talk about the emerging trends and how food is made, bought, prepared and served. </p>
    <p>According to several different sources around the country, 2008 will be the year of ethical eating. Vegetarian and locally produced food will graced more tables, wines will be more than organic they'll file-dynamic. There will be servings of microgreens you grow yourself, exotic grains such as amaranth and quinoa, and what are called probiotic dishes, food that helps digestion for inflammation. Expect a backlash against bottled water. Flavored tap water will fill our glasses instead. Bold Korean, African and Brazilian flavors will be big, but big entrees will be replaced by small plates. </p>
    <p>Artificial is out, junk food will lose its junk ingredients. Authentic is in. Phytonutrients are in, antioxidants are out. Gogi berries and pomegranates are in. The blood orange is the new super fruit. Salt is the new balsamic vinegar. Tea is the new coffee. And caffeine will still be king. Cupcakes apparently are last year. This year go for the pudding or better yet savor a nice piece of dark chocolate candy. </p>
