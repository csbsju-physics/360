    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>From NPR News, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>And joining us from Jamaica today is puzzle master Will Shortz. </p>
    <p>Hey, Will, I understand you're attending a friend's wedding. </p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ: That's right. I'm best man for a friend's wedding this weekend. And so we're in Kingston, Jamaica. I'm just having a great time. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Is it nice and warm? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: It is so warm. It's 80 degrees today. When I left New York, it was under 20. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Wow. Wow. Before we begin the puzzle today, I want to mention some new words that are going to be coming up, not only in a few moments in this program but in the food world. And I want to know if you've heard of them. The first is Veganomicon. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: No. What is that? </p>
    <p>HANSEN: It's an all-encompassing cookbook. Given the title was kind of a tongue-in-cheek, sci-fi thing, but it's all recipes vegan. How about a vegangelical? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: I've never heard that before. No. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Someone who preaches the gospel of vegan. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Okay. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: I thought you'd like to know that because, after our segment, we have some chefs from the post-punk kitchen who are considering all things vegan - exotic ingredients and easy substitutes for dairy products. These women play guitar with oven mitts and they bake cupcakes - Tiramisu cupcakes. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Wow. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: You'd never seen that on a vegan menu. Now - hmmm, yeah. Hmm, mm, mm. So that's coming up. But first, we play. And in order to do that, you have to remind us of the challenge that was to be solved over the past week. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yes. It came from listener Scott Gardener of Edwardsville, Illinois. I said, take the equation 5 + 5 + 5 = 550. And I said, make it true by adding a single line. And as a hint, I said, the answer is not a not-equal sign. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: What was your answer? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: We'll the answer is to convert one of the plus signs into a four by drawing a diagonal line from the upper left point to the leftmost point. And you get 545 + 5 = 550. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Oh, how elegant. That works very well. We had over 1,000 entries from people who solved the puzzle. Our randomly selected winner is John O'Donahue from Eugene, Oregon. </p>
    <p>Hi, John. </p>
    <p>Mr. JOHN O'DONAHUE (High School Counselor): Hi, Liane. </p>
