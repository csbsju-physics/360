<h1> "Embattled Countrywide CEO to Trim 'Parachute'" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Falling home prices and rising defaults have battered the nation's number one mortgage lender. The depth of Countrywide's financial trouble is now more apparent.  Today the company announced losses of $422 million for the most recent quarter. That compares to a $622 quarterly profit last year. The company now says one in three of its subprime loans is delinquent. And yesterday the company's outgoing CEO announced he'll forego his gold-plated severance package.  </p>
    <p>NPR's Chris Arnold reports. </p>
    <p>CHRIS ARNOLD: As Countrywide's troubles surfaced in recent months, the company's stock crashed about 90 percent. Chairman and CEO Angelo Mozilo now says he'll give up $37 million worth of severance pay and other benefits. He says, quote, "That's the right thing to do."  </p>
    <p>But consumer advocates are not clapping too loudly. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. IRA RHEINGOLD (National Association of Consumer Advocates): Well, my reaction is obviously to laugh. </p>
    <p>ARNOLD: Ira Rheingold is the head of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.  </p>
    <p>Mr. RHEINGOLD: Come on. This guy profited beyond all imagination from the terrible lending practices that Countrywide was engaged in. </p>
    <p>ARNOLD: Before the bottom fell out of his company, according to securities filings, Mozilo sold upwards of $400 million worth of stock by cashing in stock options. Speaking on CNBC last month, Mozilo defended that. </p>
    <p>Mr. ANGELO MOZILO (Countrywide CEO): I started this company with David Loeb 39 years ago. I took stock options. The stock is up 25,000 percent. During that period of time all of the shareholders had benefited with me. </p>
    <p>ARNOLD: But critics like Rheingold think Mozilo knew or should have known that when he was dumping stock, his company was a teetering house of cards. </p>
    <p>Mr. RHEINGOLD: It's amazing that he was able to time his sales better than a lot of the shareholders who stuck with it. And the notion that he can make that much profit, there's something really rotten in Denmark. </p>
    <p>ARNOLD: Mozilo has been asked to testify in Congress next month at a hearing on executive compensation. </p>
