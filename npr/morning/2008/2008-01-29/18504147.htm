    <p>Good morning. I'm Lynn Neary. </p>
    <p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy's relationship with model-turned-singer Carla Bruni has been making headlines. Now Ryanair has decided to use the couple's image in a French newspaper advertisement. The ad has a comic book style bubble over Bruni's head that reads, With Ryanair all my family can come to the wedding. The president isn't amused. He hasn't even proposed. He's seeking legal action against the airline. </p>
