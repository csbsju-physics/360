<h1> "Mini-Motel: A Home Away from Home" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Our last word in business is about housing, of sorts. The word is mini-motel. </p>
    <p>It's a new product on the market aimed at travelers who don't want to be stranded at the airport due to delays, college students who want more privacy in the dorm, or workers who could be stuck in the office due to a storm. This one-person accommodation comes with an air mattress, reading light, alarm clock, pillow, and a canopy with a frame.  </p>
    <p>If the mini-motel sounds like a fancy tent, that's because it is. It sells for $39.95 - S'mores not included.  </p>
