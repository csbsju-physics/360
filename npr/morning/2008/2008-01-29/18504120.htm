    <p>NPR's business news starts with the Fed charting its next move.  </p>
    <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke meets with colleagues today for a regular two-day meeting. It comes a week after the Fed made a surprise rate cut aimed at stabilizing global markets and easing concerns over the U.S. economy. </p>
    <p>Today the Fed decides whether to cut rates again. By lowering its key federal funds rate, the Fed encourages banks to lower their rates on loans to consumers and businesses, hopefully stimulating economic activity. </p>
    <p>Yesterday a new report showed new home sales tumbling. That's adding to expectations that the Fed will cut rates another half a percentage point. </p>
