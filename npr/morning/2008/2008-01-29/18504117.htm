<h1> "Cell Phone Reads to the Blind" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>These days it seems like cell phones can do just about everything - take photos, send e-mail, let you listen to music or watch a movie. Okay, how about a phone that can look at printed words and read them to you out loud?  </p>
    <p>NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has this report on a new cell phone being marketed to people who are blind. </p>
    <p>NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: If you're a person with normal vision who can read, there are thousands of things you do every day without even thinking about it. Little problems you solve with just a glance. </p>
    <p>Mr. JAMES GASHEL (K-NFB Reading Technology, Inc.): You know how those bags are in the hotel where you want to make the coffee? How many of you know the caffeinated from the decaf?  </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd) </p>
    <p>Mr. GASHEL: Yeah. I know it every single morning. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: James Gashel is blind. But he can get his caffeine fix with help from his cell phone. </p>
    <p>Mr. GASHEL: All you have to do is snap a picture of the bag and it tells you. </p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: Gashel is showing off his new phone in a hotel ballroom filled with people who have come to check it out. Many are holding white canes. There's a seeing eye dog resting by the walls. Everyone listens to the small silver phone as Gashel holds it a few inches above a green rectangle. </p>
    <p>CELL PHONE VOICE: Taking picture. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of clicking) </p>
    <p>CELL PHONE VOICE: Detecting orientation, processing U.S. currency image, please wait. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd) </p>
    <p>CELL PHONE VOICE: Twenty dollars.  </p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: The phone is loaded up with software developed by the company that Gashel works for. It's called K-NFB Reading Technology. That's K as in Kurzweil, the inventor Ray Kurzweil, and NFB as in the National Federation of the Blind. </p>
    <p>Besides reading labels and telling a 20 from a 10, the phone can read pages of printed text. Gashel holds it over a sheet of paper.  </p>
    <p>Mr. GASHEL: Pictures is snapped. Now I've put the reader down.   </p>
    <p>CELL PHONE VOICE: Proceeding to a specific location is a journey. Progressing to an unidentified destination is adventure. In other words, if you know where you're going, it's travel; if you don't, it's exploration. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of applause) </p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: Reading machines have been around for decades. This company already makes a hand-held device. But this reader is the smallest yet, just four ounces and a few inches long, and it's in a high-end Nokia phone with features like an MP3 player, high-speed data connection, and a GPS navigation system.  </p>
    <p>That's appealing to people like Mike Hanson(ph) from Minnesota. He uses a desktop reading machine for all kinds of things. </p>
    <p>Mr. MIKE HANSON (Lawyer): Books, mails, bills. I'm a lawyer, so I will use it to read materials related to cases I'm working on.  </p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: But he never wanted a hand-held reader before. He saw it as just one more gadget to lug around. This multi-functional cell phone though is a different story.  </p>
    <p>Mr. HANSON: Yeah. It's next on my list of technology items to seriously consider.  </p>
    <p>GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's not an impulse buy, he says. The phone plus the software costs around $2,000. </p>
