<h1> "A Divine Spot to Await the Super Bowl" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>Football fans may already be praying for their team to win the Super Bowl or at least for a room in Phoenix this late in the game. You can do the praying in the room at Our Lady of Guadalupe Monastery. The Benedictine nuns there are now renting rooms to Super Bowl-goers. No rowdy behavior allowed and it's 250 bucks for a bed. But that could include a little divine intervention. </p>
    <p>This is MORNING EDITION. </p>
