    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>While change has trumped experience as the key word of the election primaries, subprime was 2007's Word of the Year for the American Dialect Society. Runners-up include green and waterboarding. Besides its conventional use in the mortgage crises, subprime has taken on new meanings. A spokesman for the group says students now use the word to refer to tests â€” as in I subprimed this, or messed it up. </p>
