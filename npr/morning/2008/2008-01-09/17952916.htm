<h1> "Digital Dining the Latest in Self Service" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  </p>
    <p>Our last word in business is digital dining.  </p>
    <p>By now we're used to pumping our own gas, checking ourselves out of the supermarket and checking ourselves in at the airport. The latest in self-service technology is a touch-screen at your restaurant table. It allows you to place orders directly with the kitchen. Why keep a waitress waiting while you agonize over fries or onion rings?  </p>
    <p>The company behind the technology says it provides faster service and fewer mistakes. It also makes it easier to order that extra slice of pie. I don't think the screens have an icon where you can pound your fist if you're unhappy with the food, but there's always the button to summon a real live waiter. And you can complain to that person. </p>
