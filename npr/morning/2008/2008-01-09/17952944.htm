    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>A man named Virgilio Cintron died of natural causes in New York. And that left his roommate staring at Cintron's Social Security check. Police say the roommate wanted to cash that check. So with an accomplice, he allegedly hoisted the dead man on an office chair. They wheeled him through the streets to a check-cashing business. Police stopped them just as they were about to roll in the body for a creative conversation with the cashier. </p>
