    <p>The head of the nation's largest phone company says the slowing economy is hurting his business. AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, yesterday said his company has cut off service to a number of landline and home broadband customers. He wouldn't say how many people had stopped paying their bills but he blames the weak economy.  </p>

    <p>INSKEEP: I just wanted to make sure we still had our service. </p>
    <p>Stephenson said wireless customers are hanging in there because cell phones are the last thing that consumers would surrender. His comments add to the growing talk of a possible recession, and his company's shares took a hit on Wall Street.  </p>
