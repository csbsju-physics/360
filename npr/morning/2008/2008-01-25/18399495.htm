<h1> "Collecting More Than an Obsession for New Yorker" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>And it's time now for StoryCorps, the project in which Americans talk about their lives. And today, we'll hear from Harley Spiller. He's a collector. For 40 years, he has stockpiled things like the world's largest private collection of takeout menus. And that earned him a place in the Guinness World Records.</p>
    <p>HARLEY SPILLER: A couple of hundred funky neckties.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: I mean, I know it's unusual, but I think I've got it under control. I think I'm right on the border between obsessed and intelligent about these things. I don't really care about the stuff. That's the bottom line. I don't care about my menus. If they were to disappear tomorrow, I'd still know everything I know about them, and that's what matters.</p>
