<h1> "Florida Republicans Weigh Primary Options" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>NPR's Linda Wertheimer has been talking with voters in south Florida about their choices.</p>
    <p>LINDA WERTHEIMER: Campaigners were recruiting in the student union when we were there, including an enthusiastic Jesus Valentino(ph) for Ron Paul.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: And while I am not gay myself, I think they should be allowed to get married. But I don't think I want to spend more taxes dollars to do so.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: We met with Cuban American members of the Republican club at FIU. They are finding their choices difficult.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: Frankly, I'm terrified of Giuliani's foreign policy. Republicans are, you know, originally from their foundations, isolationists and more, you know, intra-America rather than, you know, the interventionist foreign policy - originally. And none of these candidates are so much in that mold.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: So where does that leave you, do you think?</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: In a nice little state of limbo here, you know.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: Juan Carlos Robina(ph) is majoring in political science. He voted early for McCain, who proved to be the favorite with this group.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: He's always stuck to his guns, but has been willing to compromise like immigration which is a big issue for me. Maybe being Hispanic gives me a different perspective, but I see the fact that people already here, we need to realize that they're not going anywhere. We need to start getting them into the system, how - whatever word you want to use for it.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: Johnny Betancourt(ph) is a chemistry major. I asked him about Cuba.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: Coming from a more Americanized family, that actually wouldn't be a voting issue for me or probably my parents. In fact, national intervention in Cuba might be seen more like an analogue to spreading democracy in the Middle East.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: We met with members of the Broward County Republican Club at a law firm where Lee Monty(ph) was one of several who described themselves as investors. Lee Monty is for Mitt Romney.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: I like to think Mitt fits. I think his experience as a CEO is very valuable because since I'm interested in the markets and investments, every conservative thing that I want him to be he is. I mean, think he's perfect.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: Jack Fernari(ph) is a retired businessman, and he was critical.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: I find his behavior offensive. I find him calling himself a Catholic offensive. If you can't control your own family, you're not going to control this country. And if you can't control your libido, I have a problem about what kind of president you're going to make. We went through that in the '90s with Bill Clinton. I wouldn't like to see it done on our side.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: Ron Price(ph) says he is a libertarian Republican like Alan Greenspan. Price told us he is supporting McCain, but only sort of.</p>
    <p>WERTHEIMER: I'm making a pragmatic decision. I don't think Romney's electable because of his religion. I don't think Giuliani's electable because of what you've heard said here tonight. And they're probably two of the best qualified. I would say McCain is electable and probably the only one of the candidates that has a possibility of winning in November.</p>
