<h1> "Supreme Court Seems Split Over Lethal Injection" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, Host: </p>
    <p>NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has more.</p>
    <p>NINA TOTENBERG: But the procedures used by the state were so complicated as to invite problems, and that a simple alternative was available. That didn't seem to impress conservative members of the court like Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>
    <p>ANTONIN SCALIA: This is an execution, not surgery. The other side contends that to know whether the person is unconscious or not, all it takes is a slap in the face and shaking the person.</p>
    <p>DONALD VERRILLI: Justice Breyer observed that death penalty supporters see this challenge as something of a ruse.</p>
    <p>BREYER: What the other side says is well you are just trying to do this by the back door, insist upon a procedure that can't be used.</p>
    <p>VERRILLI: Well, I think that one point of the one-drug protocol, of course, is to demonstrate that we're not doing that.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: In short, said lawyer Verrilli, the challenges are offering a viable one-drug alternative. Chief Justice Roberts...</p>
    <p>ROBERTS: Do we know whether there are risks of pain accompanying that method?</p>
    <p>VERRILLI: I think you do, Mr. Chief Justice because by definition, barbiturates cannot inflict pain.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: Justice Breyer said, however, that he remains unpersuaded by the studies he has seen about the relative merits of different methods to end a life by lethal injection.</p>
    <p>BREYER: I'm left at sea. I understand your contention. You claim that this is somehow more painful than some other method. But which?</p>
    <p>VERRILLI: Well...</p>
    <p>BREYER: And what's the evidence for that? What do I read to find it?</p>
    <p>VERRILLI: The thiopental is a barbiturate that by definition will inflict death painlessly.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: Justice Stevens followed up...</p>
    <p>STEVENS: What is the justification for the second drug?</p>
    <p>ROY ENGLERT: It does bring about a more dignified death - dignified for the inmate, dignified for the witnesses.</p>
    <p>STEVENS: So the dignity of the process outweighs the risk of excruciating pain.</p>
    <p>ENGLERT: No, your honor. No. It takes a very long time to die with the one- drug protocol.</p>
    <p>STEVENS: It's very long then - 10 minutes?</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: Here, for example, is Justice Souter...</p>
    <p>SOUTER: What's disturbing Justice Breyer, what's disturbing me and others is, we want some kind of a definitive decision here. And it seems to me that the most expeditious way of getting it - if comparative analysis is appropriate - and I will be candid to say I think it is - is to send this case back and say, okay, do a comparative analysis. Make the findings.</p>
