<h1> "Voices from South Carolina" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>From NPR News this is WEEKEND EDITION. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd chanting) </p>
    <p>Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Presidential Candidate): Thank you. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd chanting) </p>
    <p>Sen. OBAMA: Thank you. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Senator Barack Obama rocked South Carolina yesterday, taking 55 percent of the vote in the primary. </p>
    <p>Sen. OBAMA: I did not travel around this state over the last year to see a white South Carolina or a black South Carolina. I saw South Carolina. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd cheering) </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Senator Hillary Clinton was in distant second with 27 percent, and John Edwards came in with 18 percent. </p>
    <p>Here's how South Carolinians reacted last night. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: I think it's going to propel him to win the entire presidency. On Super Tuesday, he'll take most of the states. He'll close the gap between him and Clinton. And I think his speech today was the best speech I've ever heard him make. And I think if he keeps that message and just drives that home, he can win everything. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman #1: Yes, I'm a little bit disappointed, obviously, but we still feel that Hillary is the one. She's in it for the long haul. We know next week there are 22 states that are going to be voting. I've seen her speak a number of times, and just am so impressed every time I do. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #2: I think the media tries to make Barack the Jesse Jackson-type candidate, where he was just going to win the black vote and not take any percent of, like, white votes. And I think South Carolina voters actually spoke up tonight and said that, you know, they're against that type of politics. And Barack is a well-rounded candidate that can pick up white and black voters. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Female #2: Well, I'm thinking I wish we could have come in second. But it's not over yet, not over yet. There's still the big Tuesday, February 5th, so never over until it's over. </p>
