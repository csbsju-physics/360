<h1> "Guess the Rest" </h1>
    <p>LIANE HANSEN, host: </p>
    <p>From NPR News, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I'm Liane Hansen. </p>
    <p>And joining us is puzzlemaster Will Shortz. </p>
    <p>Hi, Will. </p>
    <p>WILL SHORTZ: Hi, Liane. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: How are you? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Doing fine. How about you? </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Very well. Thanks. So you left us with a challenge that we haven't had in a long time, last week. It involved a spoonerism. First of all, define spoonerism and then remind us of the challenge. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Well, a spoonerism is where you reverse the initial consonant sounds of a phrase or a word to make something different. And the example I gave was right lane. You spoonerize that and you get light rain. And I said, think of a familiar two-word phrase for an activity in a riding stable, spoonerize it and you'll get another familiar two-word phrase for something a stable worker handles. What is it? </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Just to show you how long it's been, a lot of people had trouble with this because we only had about 100 entries from people who solved the puzzle. What was the answer, Will? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Well, the activity in a riding stable is horse care. And something a stable worker handles is coarse hair. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Oh. Our randomly selected winner is Jeanne Colley from Morrow, Ohio. </p>
    <p>Hi, Jeanne. </p>
    <p>Ms. JEANNE COLLEY: Hi. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: How long have you been playing this puzzle? </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Since the beginning. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: All right. Will reminded me last week that we've been doing this on the air 21 years and one week, right, Will? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's right. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah. What did you get me? </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>HANSEN: A lapel pin. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Another puzzle. Yeah. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Oh, thank you so much. Anyway, Jeanne, you've been waiting for so long. Are you ready? </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: I guess so. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Okay. Will, meet Jeanne. Let's play. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right, Jeanne. Every answer today is a familiar three-word phrase in the form blank the blank. I'll give you rhymes for the first and last words in the phrases. You tell me the phrases. For example, if I said lease the reels, you would say grease the wheels. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Okay. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: All right? Number one is swallow the reader. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Follow the leader. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Follow the leader is right. Number two is throw the missile. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Blow the whistle. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Blow the whistle. Good. Grace the station. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Liane, help. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: No. I'm going through my alphabet. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Face the nation. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Good for you. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Face the nation. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: I don't get to see it. I'm on the radio. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Ruffle the check. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Shuffle the deck. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Good. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Shuffle the deck. Good. Bring the booze. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Sing the blues? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Sing the blues. Shake the sponge. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Shake the sponge? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Uh-huh. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Take the plunge. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Take the plunge. Good. Churn the hopes. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Learn the ropes. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Learn the ropes. Best the daughters. I think I've - off the top my head, I can think of only one rhyme for daughters. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Otters. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah, me too. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Oh. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: No. There's two rhymes for… </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>SHORT: Maybe you… </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Squatters. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Waters. Test the waters. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Waters? </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Waters. Test the waters. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Test the waters. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Excellent. Right. Try this one. Thrill the queens. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: This is something you do when you tell a secret. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Yeah, it's right. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: When what? </p>
    <p>HANSEN: When you tell a secret. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: I'm stumped. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Spill the beans. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Spill the beans. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Spills the beans. Good one, Liane. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: I feel I should whisper it to you, Jeanne. Spill the beans. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: That's correct. Okay. Here's your next clue. Quit the throttle. Quit the throttle. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Quit the throttle. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Quit, Q-U-I-T. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Hit the bottle? </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Hit the bottle. Good. Take the yank. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Walk - no, ain't it. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: I just got the plank. Walk the plank but… </p>
    <p>HANSEN: That works for me. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: No. But walk doesn't rhyme with take. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: But I like it. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Take the yank. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Take the… </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Bank. Break the bank. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Bake - break the bank. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Break… </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Break the bank. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Good. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Good one. Good one. Praise the spoof. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Praise the spoof? Raise the roof? </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yeah. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Raise the roof is right. Mute the sleaze. If you're just gossiping or chatting with someone, this is what you… </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Oh, shoot the breeze. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: shoot the breeze is right. And here is your last one. Cheat the jock. And if you are… </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Beat the clock. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Yes. </p>
    <p>SHORTZ: Beat the clock is correct. Nice job. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Kick. Kick. Oh, Jeanne, was it worth the wait? </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Yes. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: Okay. </p>
    <p>Ms. COLLEY: Yes. I'm just happy to be here. </p>
    <p>HANSEN: This was a lot of fun. Did you have fun? </p>
