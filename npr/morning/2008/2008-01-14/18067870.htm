<h1> "TV's Judge Alex Goes to the Supreme Court" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: </p>
    <p>And today at the U.S. Supreme Court, there will be one more judge.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "JUDGE ALEX")</p>
    <p>U: Judge Alex.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg explains.</p>
    <p>NINA TOTENBERG: Judge Alex will not be in costume today, no robe. He's not appearing as a judge, but as a litigant. In case you've never heard of Judge Alex, here's how they introduce him on TV.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "JUDGE ALEX")</p>
    <p>U: As a trial lawyer he fought for the truth, and as a criminal court judge he commanded authority. Now he returns to preside over America's courtroom - Judge Alex.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: And here's what his show sounds like.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "JUDGE ALEX")</p>
    <p>U: He says that when he split up with his ex, she split with his ride.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Were any punches being thrown or anything?</p>
    <p>U: Yes.</p>
    <p>U: A whole lot.</p>
    <p>U: A whole lot.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: Truth be told, the legal facts and questions in this case are horrifically boring. Judge Alex Ferrer and his one-time agent are in a money dispute, and the question is whether state or federal law applies.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: We're done.</p>
    <p>U: All rise.</p>
