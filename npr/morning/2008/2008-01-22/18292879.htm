<h1> "Using Fluffy as an Exercise Buddy" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. </p>
    <p>With 35 percent of dogs and cats now obese, Hollywood trainer Gunnar Peterson figures there's a market for an exercise video for pets. Out today, it features cat curls, the owner holds a flashlight while doing crunches, and the cat chases the moving light. There's a dog-stacle course, where the owner leads the dog through a step class. Or you could skip the video and just take a stick and go to the park and see Spot run. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION. </p>
