<h1> "Anheuser-Busch Leads Super Bowl Advertisers" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, host: </p>
    <p>No matter how bad things get on the global stock markets, for a few hours on the first Sunday of February, an expected 90 million Americans will tune out the economy and tune in to the Super Bowl. </p>
    <p>So our last word in business is Anheuser-Busch. Once again, the nation's biggest beer maker is grabbing the most air time during the big game. Anheuser-Busch has reportedly bought four minutes of commercial time. It will air seven ads. They'll star comedians Will Ferrell and Carlos Mencia, as well as the company's Clydesdale horses. Fox is charging up to $2.7 million for a 30-second spot. But Anheuser-Busch gets the volume discount, which means the beer maker is expected to spend only about $16 million on the Super Bowl ads. </p>
