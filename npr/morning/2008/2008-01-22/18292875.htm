<h1> "Gas at a Deep Discount" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. </p>
    <p>Here are two ways to save on gasoline costs. You can buy a plug-in hybrid car. Toyota and Ford show them off at this week's Washington Auto Show. Or you can just have a friend in the oil business. A West Virginia woman worked Sunday morning at a gas station, and police say that until her arrest Madeline Jordan would reset the price at the pumps. Friends and family in South Charleston bought gas for one-tenth of a penny per gallon. </p>
