<h1> "A Huckabee-Colbert Ticket?" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, host: </p>
    <p>This next bit of news had a television talk show host smiling. Four words - Stephen Colbert, Vice President. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of TV show, "The Colbert Report") </p>
    <p>Mr. MIKE HUCKABEE (Former Republican Governor, Arkansas; Presidential Candidate): Stephen, please, be my running mate. </p>
    <p>Mr. STEPHEN COLBERT (Host): Yes! Yes, a thousand times, yes! </p>
    <p>INSKEEP: I think that means yes. That's Mike Huckabee sealing the deal on "The Colbert Report" last night. Stephen Colbert enthusiastically agreed for the fourth time, by the way, to be Huckabee's running mate. </p>
    <p>South Carolina's Democratic Party did not allow the comedian to enter its primaries a presidential candidate. But if the former Arkansas governor gets the Republican nomination, Colbert could make the ballot after all. </p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. </p>
