<h1> "Toy Helps Preoccupy Uber Passengers " </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep with help for Uber drivers. It's a way to distract a distracting passenger. Drivers in Charlotte are equipped with a kid's toy called Bop It. It's a test of reflexes. You're supposed to press buttons when the toy tells you. It's considered a great diversion, which keeps drunk passengers from bothering the driver. Now the driver just has the problem of having to listen to the game.</p>

    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Bop it. Twist it. Shake it. Flick it.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
