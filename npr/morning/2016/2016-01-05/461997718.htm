<h1> "Appeals Court Reverses Tattoo Shop Ruling" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm David Green. A legal case in Key West became an argument about - what else? - Jimmy Buffett lyrics. The city refused to allow a new tattoo shop, and they cited "Margaritaville" - the line about a brand-new tattoo; how it got here, I haven't a clue.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MARGARITAVILLE")</p>
    <p>JIMMY BUFFETT: (Singing) I haven't a clue.</p>
    <p>GREENE: While officials thought the song might make a good point, boozy tourists could regret that ink. But an appeals court pointed out that the singer is not ashamed of his tattoo. In fact, he calls it a cutie. It's 5 o'clock somewhere, and it's MORNING EDITION.</p>
