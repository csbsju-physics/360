<h1> "Fan's Tattoo Is A Reminder Of Patriots' Loss" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good Morning. I'm Steve Inskeep with sympathy for Burke O'Connell. Last week, he got a tattoo celebrating the New England Patriots' victory in Super Bowl 50, a sign of confidence because the game has yet to take place. Soon after he got the tattoo, the Patriots lost a playoff game. They will not even play in Super Bowl 50. Mr. O'Connell is philosophical. He says the premature tat is not as bad as when he got a tattoo honoring the woman who is now his ex-girlfriend. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
