<h1> "At CES, New Robots Deliver More Coos Than Utility" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>And for some fun business news, let's talk about the robots that were popular this holiday season on the big screen.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "STAR WARS: EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE")</p>
    <p>ANTHONY DANIELS: (As C-3PO) Wait, over here.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Right now, that kind of robot is only found in "Star Wars" - too bed. NPR's Laura Sydell is at the big consumer electronics show in Las Vegas the CES, where she went to see how close we are to a real-life C-3PO.</p>
    <p>LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Meet Pepper. She's got humanoid features like eyes, arms, mouth and well, I'll let her speak for herself.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (As Pepper) I'm just about 4-feet-tall and a little under 62 pounds. Speaking of height, according to my calculations, I am .6 times the height of Michael Jordan.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Pepper rolls around on wheels and has censors so that she doesn't hit anything.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (As Pepper) Just think what a robot like me can do for you.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Well, what can a robot like Pepper do for me?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (As Pepper) I can dance. OK, well, let's go.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: But the truth is it's not that clear what Pepper can really do for me. As far as I can tell, she doesn't even twerk.</p>
    <p>RODOLPHE GELIN: Today, if you want to have Pepper, it's because it's fun.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: This is Rodolphe Gelin, the chief scientific officer at Aldebaran, the French company that makes Pepper. Aldebarren has been in robotics for over a decade. A lot of its robots are used by researchers and educators. And more recently, shops in Europe and Asia have used them to greet customers.</p>
    <p>GELIN: And today, we think that the robot is ready for this kind of application - welcoming people, having a simple dialogue, giving some information.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Gelin says Pepper has helped draw customers into shops, but she'll cost you. This year, she'll be available in the U.S. for $20,000. Yet the amount of space given to personal robots at CES is growing every year. Most are like Pepper - cute but a little unsatisfying. Take BOCCO. She looks humanoid but is only about half-a-foot tall. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: We report, based on an interview with Aldebaran Chief Scientific Officer Rodolphe Gelin, that Pepper will be available in the U.S. for $20,000. The company now says the actual cost of Pepper when the robot enters the U.S. market will be closer to $25,000 and that it will be available only to businesses.]</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (As BOCCO) I hope mom and dad stay in touch with the children and hear their voices while busy at work.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: BOCCO helps them stay in touch because parents and children can record messages on their smartphone and send them to BOCCO, who plays them back. She also can alert parents when the door of a child's room opens by sending a signal. The other robots on the floor could also do a few tasks. One washed windows, another one folded clothes, though not very well. And there was, of course, a vacuum-cleaner robot. Maryanna Saenko, an analyst with Lux Research, says what's happening is that engineers are solving one problem at a time at many different companies.</p>
    <p>MARYANNA SAENKO: The challenge is that as people solve these, they immediately want to create a market out of them. So we get these little stepwise solution in the robotic space where each little robot completes a little task.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: Saenko says the big problem is battery life.</p>
    <p>SAENKO: They're constantly computing what's going on in their space, who am I looking at, what am I trying to interact with? And so that's actually really energy intensive.</p>
    <p>SYDELL: We are slowly getting closer to making it all work, says Saenko. But buying a robot at this point is more like buying one of the early Apple computers. It's great for people who want to get in early. For the time being, the best personal robots are going to remain in a galaxy far, far away. Laura Sydell, NPR News, Las Vegas.</p>
