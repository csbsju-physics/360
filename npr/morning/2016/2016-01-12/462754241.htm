<h1> "Playboy Mansion Is For Sale. Got $200 Million?" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning I'm David Greene, calling all bachelors. The Playboy Mansion could be yours for a cool $200 million. Just think about it. You'd have 29 rooms, the famous pool with its grotto, a zoo with monkeys, exotic birds and, yes, bunnies.</p>
    <p>Just one catch - you'll be splitting utilities with Hugh Hefner. Yes, that is a condition of the sale. A statement from the magazine calls the mansion Hef's creative center, and it says the 89-year-old playboy is not going anywhere. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
