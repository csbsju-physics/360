<h1> "Eye-Catching Airbnb Listing Looks Promising But Chilly" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. Brooklyn can be a tough place to find dings, so this eye-catching Airbnb listing looked promising. For $200, stay in Snowpocalypse's most desirable getaway. Dripping with alt-lifestyle aura, come experience this chic dome-style bungalow. It was, in fact, an igloo from fresh snow. Airbnb removed the post with a note to the hopeful landlords, asking them to please list a space with a, quote, "roof that doesn't melt." It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
