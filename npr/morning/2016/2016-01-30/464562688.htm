<h1> "Anderson .Paak: 'The Dot Stands For Detail'" </h1>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "PUT ME THRU")</p>
    <p>ANDERSON .PAAK: (Singing) Why the hell would you run this game?</p>
    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p>
    <p>That's Anderson .Paak, a songwriter, singer, rapper and producer whose songs are kind of kaleidoscopes, '60s funk, '70s soul, hip-hop, R&B, electronic music and rock 'n' roll. Anderson .Paak has been developing this unique sonic blend for over a decade, but his music got a higher profile this summer when he was featured on the new album by Dr. Dre. Anderson .Paak joined us from our studios at NPR West to tell us about his new album called "Malibu" and why it's important that his last name is written .Paak.</p>
    <p>.PAAK: The dot stands for detail, always paying attention to detail. And I feel like people take you as serious as you take yourself. I spent a lot of time working on my craft, developing my style. And after I came out of my little incubation, I promised that I would pay attention to detail, and on top of that, I make sure that dot is always there to remind me and to remind others.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE SEASON")</p>
    <p>.PAAK: (Singing) Six years old, I tried my first pair of Jordans on. Momma, can you carry me? It was late in the fall. I caught a glimpse of my first love, my God. Momma, can you carry me? Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord, why they have to take Momma? Momma, carry me to the early morning.</p>
    <p>SIMON: We mentioned you worked with Dr. Dre, and you were featured as a rapper on six of the tracks of the album he released this summer. But what was it like to watch him at work? Because you're also a producer. What did you see? What did you learn?</p>
    <p>.PAAK: The first thing I noticed is he's - definitely mans the ship and he's the captain when he's in that production chair. But he's definitely open to ideas and interested in finding something. And he's not set on just having his way. I was just kind of amazed that someone of his stature and, like, success level is still really, really into just the music. He had this excitement to him, and it seemed like it was new to him, you know, like - or at least when I came in there was this - this vibe where he felt like he was so excited of what was to come, you know, and the things that we were about make. And he wanted to spend hours on finding the right - the right phrase and finding the right sound, and it just was inspiring to see that.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "AM I WRONG")</p>
    <p>.PAAK: (Singing) And look at the time, my God, so precious, is yours, is mine.</p>
    <p>SIMON: You started drumming in church.</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Yeah. I started playing drums in church in Oxnard in a church called St. Paul Baptist Church. My godsister invited me to church when I was about 11 years old after I had, you know, learned how to play a couple beats. And she was like, you should come to the church. You go to see the choir and you got to see the church band. And I went and I saw the choir and the church band and I was hooked. I just never seen any kind of playing. I'd never been in a black Baptist church before - before that and I just was in love with the energy. And...</p>
    <p>SIMON: Yeah. We'll explain, you're from a mixed ethnic background, too.</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Yeah. My mom was born in Korea, so Korea during the '50s, '51. And she was abandoned, so she - her and my uncle were abandoned and my grandfather was a Seabee and adopted my mom and my uncle and brought them to Compton in the '50s. That's where she was raised and...</p>
    <p>SIMON: Farmers, right?</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so, yeah, my mom eventually got out to Oxnard and I started a produce company and was in the strawberry business. My pops was out of the picture around the time I was 7. He ended up getting really addicted to drugs and alcohol. And up until that point, he was doing really good and the drugs kind of got a hold of him and he went to prison for about 14 years for assault.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE BIRD")</p>
    <p>.PAAK: (Singing) I'm repping for the longest cycle. My uncle's had to pay the cost. My sister used to sing to Whitney. My momma caught the gambling bug. We came up in a lonely castle. My papa was behind the bars. We never had to want for nothing. Said all we ever need is love. We see the same thing.</p>
    <p>My pops ended up joining the military really, really early. Eventually, he was dishonorably discharged because of weed, I think</p>
    <p>SIMON: Weed you said.</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Yeah, my mom just tell me when he got discharged he kind of just - I think he went into a depression after that 'cause he really liked being in the service. And after that he kind of just kind of done a downhill spiral. It's pretty rough, bro.</p>
    <p>SIMON: It's pretty rough. I was about to say, it seems almost a shame to talk about music now, but I also think your music is wound up with that, right?</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Yeah, yeah, that's the light, you know, and thank God for the music, you know?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CELEBRATE")</p>
    <p>.PAAK: (Singing) Time never cares if you're there or not there. All you ever needed was a simple plan but you're doing well. I mean, you're not dead, so let's celebrate while we still can.</p>
    <p>SIMON: So do you work things out in the music?</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Yeah, I do and I just try not to have too much compromise. I try not to get too heady with it. I try to just express with the art and always be working it to get better and learn more and to develop more and get sharper and inspire and put things out that people are going to feel good about and people are going to feel cool and sexy and the things that I feel when I'm making it.</p>
    <p>SIMON: Well, you're a pleasure to speak with. I wish you so much luck.</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Thank you so much, man. That was awesome. I appreciate it.</p>
    <p>SIMON: Anderson .Paak - his new album - "Malibu." I hope we speak with you again.</p>
    <p>.PAAK: Absolutely, I'll be back.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CELEBRATE")</p>
    <p>.PAAK: (Singing) Captivated, the fruits of my family tree. Where would I be without you? What would you do without me? It'd be a bad look talking about what could have been, so let's celebrate while we still can. On a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown...</p>
