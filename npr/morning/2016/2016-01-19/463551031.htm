    <p>DAVID BOWIE: (Singing) This is Major Tom to ground control.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And the stars do look very different today. Belgian astronomers have honored David Bowie with a constellation. Look up and see it near Mars - seven stars shaped like a lightning bolt - a tribute to the man who brought us "Space Oddity," "Starman" and "Life On Mars." Bowie may now be in the great unknown, but his constellation shines on. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
