<h1> "Shawn Amos' Long Road To Old-School Blues" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>Shawn Amos has worn a lot of hats in the music industry - singer, songwriter, producer. He started out in folk rook (ph) - folk rock mode, rather. But lately, he's a vessel for the blues.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DAYS OF DEPRESSION")</p>
    <p>SHAWN AMOS: (Singing) In my days of depression, I could take my hand off the wheel. Let me go where the wind blows. Let me go with the Lord.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: His newest album is "The Reverend Shawn Amos Loves You." He spoke with Karen Grigsby Bates from NPR's Code Switch team about the source of his inspiration.</p>
    <p>KAREN GRIGBY BATES, BYLINE: Shawn Amos had a Los Angeles childhood that was equal parts grit and glamour.</p>
    <p>AMOS: I grew in Hollywood in the '70s, when it was...</p>
    <p>BATES: Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, yeah.</p>
    <p>AMOS: ...Far different than it is now (laughter).</p>
    <p>BATES: He went to private schools and lived in a nice house, but it wasn't exactly in Mr. Rogers's neighborhood.</p>
    <p>AMOS: I grew up waiting for a carpool with hookers (laughter) who knew me by name, and I knew drug dealers by name. And I lived across from an apartment complex that was sort of a home to all the pumping iron, sort of bodybuilding, gay porn kind of guys.</p>
    <p>MARTIN: Shawn's dad, Wally Amos, was a former Hollywood talent agent who'd became a celebrity by creating Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies. His mother, Shirlee Ellis, was a former nightclub singer who performed as Shirl-ee May. She was a great beauty, but she also suffered from schizoaffective disorder.</p>
    <p>AMOS: My mother committed suicide in 2003. She was severely mentally ill my whole life. And she'd given up her career long before I was born and so I never knew her as that Shirl-ee May figure of the clubs.</p>
    <p>BATES: He tried to work his way through the hole she left by writing a tribute album to her.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THANK YOU SHIRL-EE MAY")</p>
    <p>AMOS: (Singing) She came on strong and she went too fast. I try to keep it in the past. Thank you, Shirl-ee May.</p>
    <p>BATES: Some songs were upbeat. Others had agony and a little anger.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GOOD INSIDE")</p>
    <p>AMOS: (Singing) I know when enough's enough. I know that my best ain't much. Why must you always kill what's good inside?</p>
    <p>BATES: The critics praised his maiden effort, but it didn't sell, which crushed him. After a couple other albums suffered the same fate, Amos withdrew from performing.</p>
    <p>AMOS: I sort of felt like I can't approach music that way anymore. I can't, like, go into making music just pulling my heart wide open. It's just too hard for me, and I didn't know how else to approach music.</p>
    <p>BATES: He decided to put his own songs aside and worked in the industry as an artist representative and a producer. He compiled the greatest hits of popular, alive and not, for Rhino Records and the Shout Factory.</p>
    <p>And he produced albums for the likes of Heart, Quincy Jones and the great R&B man Solomon Burke.</p>
    <p>AMOS: I was with him in the studio for three records, and I sat as close to him singing as we are now.</p>
    <p>BATES: It was fulfilling work, and Amos was content doing it until he got an offer, in 2013, to front a friend's blues band for a weeklong tour in Italy.</p>
    <p>And was it fun?</p>
    <p>AMOS: It was life-changing.</p>
    <p>BATES: The music was loud and energetic and happy. For once, he wasn't playing through pain or anxiety.</p>
    <p>AMOS: I was just playing from a place of joy, and I just wanted to celebrate.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "PUT TOGETHER")</p>
    <p>AMOS: (Singing) With your do-rag, honey, you're all right. Baby, you're put together. The way you shake-shake, making crazy - honey, you're put together. I just want to come home.</p>
    <p>BATES: He didn't so much want to imitate classic delta or Chicago blues. He wanted something else.</p>
    <p>AMOS: I thought - like, what if Muddy Waters made a record today? Not like, trying to, like, pay homage to Muddy back then. (Unintelligible) a lot of people - oh, well, we'll do a record just like they did it back in 1950 whatever. But what if these guys were alive today and made a record today? What would they be talking about? And what would it sound like? And how would they take advantage of technology, but not turn it into, you know, a super slick rock record?</p>
    <p>BATES: Old school, new tools. That's the guiding principle Shawn Amos applies as he plays around the country. There's a good chance he might be coming to your town. He's done 200 shows in the last two years, and each one is part of his mission.</p>
    <p>AMOS: Keeping the blues alive, one gig at a time.</p>
    <p>BATES: With joy.</p>
