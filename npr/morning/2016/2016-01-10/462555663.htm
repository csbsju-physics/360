<h1> "How Obama's Proposals Are Playing Out At Gun Shows" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>It's been a good month for gun sales. Even before President Obama announced actions aimed at tightening controls on gun purchases, sales were up, partly in reaction to terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Gun dealers say the president's initiatives have spurred sales. At the same time, polling shows more than two thirds of Americans support the president's proposals, including a majority of gun owners.</p>
    <p>NPR's Greg Allen visited a gun show in Miami this past weekend and has this report.</p>
    <p>GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Hundreds of people were lined up when the gun show opened yesterday at the fairgrounds in Miami. It was mostly men, but there were quite a few women and even some kids. Winter is a busy time for gun sales in Florida, but this gun show was busier than usual.</p>
    <p>WILL REYNOLDS: You have to be quick, man. I have 30 seconds because look at all the people we have here.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: Will Reynolds owns LeadFeather Guns & Archery. He had several tables in the middle of the exhibition hall with an array of expensive-looking handguns.</p>
    <p>REYNOLDS: We primarily just specialize in firearms. We love SIG Sauer. We carry a lot of those. We have the FNX Tacticals, Smith & Wesson, Ruger, Walther - all the high-quality stuff.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: Reynolds says he hasn't read through the president's proposals, but he's leery some of the rules may put new burdens on federally licensed dealers like him. But Obama, he says, is good for business.</p>
    <p>REYNOLDS: Any time he seems like he talks about firearms, attendance goes up. Any time that there is a mishap or an accident or something like San Bernardino, people are scared, petrified. And they want to protect themselves. At the same time, they feel like they don't want to lose their rights.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: Among President Obama's proposals this week were some aimed at closing what he called the gun show loophole. Right now at gun shows, federally licensed firearms dealers like Reynolds conduct background checks on all sales. But looking around the hall, Reynolds says there are many here selling guns with few questions asked.</p>
    <p>REYNOLDS: There are people that are walking around here that can come in and pay the entry fee and sell three, five, six, 10 guns if they want to. And they're not getting background checks. It happens right here. If you stand around long enough, you'll see people doing cash transactions on this floor today.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: The president is proposing requiring many more people who sell guns to get federal licenses and conduct background checks. The rules still have to be written. The White House says they're not aimed at collectors but notes that even a few transactions combined with other evidence may qualify someone as a dealer. Alfredo del Portillo is a gun owner and collector who was walking around the hall with three semi-automatic rifles.</p>
    <p>ALFREDO DEL PORTILLO: I'm selling a couple and always looking.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: Del Portillo said the president's comments had created uncertainty now about how informal sales and trading can be conducted.</p>
    <p>DEL PORTILLO: Some people are telling me that I have to go through a dealer right now. Other people are saying no, not yet. Nobody seems to know. Who says who's a casual occasional seller?</p>
    <p>ALLEN: That's a question even more important to the hobbyists and collectors who pay $100 to rent a table and buy, sell and trade at weekend gun shows, people like William McDowell.</p>
    <p>WILLIAM MCDOWELL: Well, I have an archery shop, but I do gun shows on the weekends. If we do sell a gun, by law right now, it's not required that we do a background check.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: McDowell says his customers looking to buy, sell or trade vintage firearms aren't the ones likely to cause trouble. But if required to do background checks, he says, he'll do them.</p>
    <p>MCDOWELL: I don't have a problem with that.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: Another collector Ron Wires said he's worried new federal regulations will make his hobby, trading and selling old guns and knives, a lot more expensive.</p>
    <p>RON WIRES: You take a private collector like me - I'm retired. I'm on Social Security, trying to make a couple of bucks. If I have to get licensed, how do I do a background check? Then it's cost-prohibitive. I can't even collect anymore.</p>
    <p>ALLEN: With the high volume of sales at Miami's gun show yesterday, customers were lined up waiting for clerks on computers to complete their background checks. Checks that should take a few minutes were taking an hour or more, but it didn't seem to be hurting business.</p>
