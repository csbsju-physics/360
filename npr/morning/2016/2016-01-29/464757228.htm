<h1> "How Do Voters Really Feel This Election? We Asked" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>What are you so angry about? What are you so anxious about? Those are the questions we've been posing to American voters. It's a nationwide conversation we've been conducting this week. It started on MORNING EDITION and continued on NPR member stations across the country. Among them was KQED in San Francisco where host Michael Krasny fielded calls.</p>

    <p>MICHAEL KRASNY, BYLINE: Ky (ph) joins us. First of all, what are you anxious about, Ky?</p>
    <p>KY: Well, being a high school senior, I'm just really anxious about the cost of college. You know, I'm looking at the UC systems and out-of-state systems, and, wow, their costs are just out of the roof.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: New Hampshire Public Radio also took calls and message. Voters, of course, go to the polls there on February 9 in the first presidential primary. Here's radio host Laura Knoy.</p>

    <p>LAURA KNOY, BYLINE: We also got a Facebook comment from Joe. Joes says, I'm 100 times more concerned about our disintegrating infrastructure than I am about terrorists. Joe says, I'm more likely to get killed by a bridge falling on my head than I am by ISIS.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That's a comment on the air in New Hampshire. While in Cincinnati, Ohio, reporters from WVXU talked with voters on the streets.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: The own the only thing I worry about is the Obamacare. I don't want that repealed.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I'm really heartbroken about our schools because I have a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old, and they can't write. They don't know how to sign their signature.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: While reporters from member station KERA in Dallas talked with Republicans at a straw poll.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: The evangelicals feel that they have been left out. They worked and worked and worked for all these candidates, and then they get there and, by golly, they don't represent them when they get there.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And Georgia Public Broadcasting producers fanned out across the state to ask people about the presidential race.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>STACY JONES: My name is Stacy Jones (ph) and I'm 28 years old. And I feel like it's a show, like a clown show. I don't feel as interested in it as I did the previous election.</p>
    <p>MARQUIS SMITH: My name is Marquis Smith (ph) and I'm 23 years old. I'm feeling quite a bit anxious about the election. I feel like with major elections, especially presidential elections, it really brings out the worst in people. And it's just like, is this really what our American government is coming to, to - making a mockery it seems like. Makes you worry a little bit.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Those are some of the voices heard on public radio stations around this country as we asked Americans what they're anxious about in this election season.</p>
