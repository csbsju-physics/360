<h1> "Oregon Judge: Protester's Nudity Isn't Covered By The Constitution" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Free speech is not quite that free. A Portland, Ore., man said authorities violated his rights. He was arrested for indecent exposure for playing the violin while naked outside a courthouse. He sued, claiming a First Amendment right to be unclothed. But The Oregonian newspaper reports a judge disagreed. The nudity had no specific message. So in his case, the act of leaving his body uncovered was also not covered by the Constitution. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
