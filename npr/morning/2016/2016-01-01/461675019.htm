<h1> "Wis. Mayor Tries To Create New Holiday Tradition" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. Green Bay, Wis., kicked off the new year by parading a llama downtown. Why a llama? - you ask. Well. Mayor Jim Schmitt explained to TV station WBAY.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>JIM SCHMITT: Legend has it that if you view this llama on New Year's Eve, good things will come your way the following year.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Having said that, Mayor Schmitt confessed it's all made up. He just wants to start a new tradition, and he prefers the llama to Green Bay's other option, a giant illuminated cheesehead.</p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
