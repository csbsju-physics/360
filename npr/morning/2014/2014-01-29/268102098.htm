<h1> "Rep. Michael Grimm Threatens Reporter" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>Congressman Michael Grimm explains he was annoyed. He went on live TV to comment on the State of the Union speech. At the end, the reporters started to ask about a problem with one of Grimm's campaign contributors. Grimm stormed off. The camera was still on when he returned and said: I'll break you in half. Later, Grimm called the reporter disrespectful. Then again, I'd never heard of his campaign trouble until he so dramatically declined to address it.</p>
