    <p>And I'm Steve Inskeep. The math for Obamacare is improving but still not quite adding up. New numbers from the federal government yesterday show that 2.2 million Americans signed up for private health insurance by the end of the last year under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: But not so many of those enrolled are in the demographic the government really needs. That's younger people between 18 and 34 years old. They are the people who tend to be healthier and pay insurance premiums without needing much care.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Fewer than a quarter of those enrolled are in that younger category - not nearly as many as the program needs to stay financially sound.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: People in the 55 to 64 age group make up the largest percentage of those who have enrolled so far. The administration says it's ramping up outreach efforts. Open enrollment runs through March 31st.</p>
