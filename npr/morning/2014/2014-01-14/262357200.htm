    <p>NPR's business news starts with a change in the weather.</p>

    <p>INSKEEP: Things are looking a little bleak for the Weather Channel. Visibility is low. Its contract negotiations with DirecTV fell through. The satellite broadcaster dropped the Weather Channel last night after the two companies could not agree on a new distribution deal.</p>
    <p>DirecTV is the largest satellite TV distributor in the United States with over 20 million subscribers. And DirecTV has now replaced the Weather Channel with Weather Nation - which we're told, offers 24/7 weather reporting and updates.</p>
    <p>Recently, the Weather Channel has diversified its programming from continuous weather coverage to include reality TV shows and documentaries, a change that DirecTV said its subscribers were concerned about.</p>
