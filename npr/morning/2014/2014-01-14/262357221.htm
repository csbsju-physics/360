<h1> "Pope To Sell Harley To Benefit Homeless" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business today is: Pope on a Hog.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Of course it is.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Stop. There have been many famous owners of Harley Davidson over the years - Elvis Presley, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Hells Angels, - but Pope Francis might be the holiest roller yet.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Almost by definition. He's the proud owner - the pope is - of a Harley Davidson Dyna Super Glide, which was given to him as a gift.</p>
    <p>But His Holiness will auction the hog to help raise money for a soup kitchen and a hostel for the homeless in Rome.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: The motorcycle is signed Francisco on its tank and is worth as much as $20,000 at auction. Pope Francis already owns a decidedly less pimped-out Ford Focus.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: And that's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News, the one program that manages to get the phrase pimped out into a story that is about the pope.</p>
    <p>I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BORN TO BE WILD")</p>
