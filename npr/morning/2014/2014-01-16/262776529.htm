<h1> "Sometimes A Perfect Stranger Is The Best Dinner Host" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Now we have the story of people who are eating out by dining in. Numerous websites seek to connect diners with home cooking in someone else's house. Eat With or Side Tour or VoulezVous promise to connect you with a stranger who would happy to have you over for dinner.</p>
    <p>Reporter Arun Venugopal, of member station WNYC, gave it a try.</p>
    <p>ARUN VENUGOPAL, BYLINE: It's easy to think that this latest foodie trend sweeping New York and other cities is all about the food. Mmm, can't wait to get that home-cooked meal in Chinatown.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER)</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: But it's not.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I know baseball.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: The food is often just an excuse...</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I know the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to L.A.</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: ...for what can essentially be a really great party with a bunch of people you've never met.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You say Jay Z, because in my funny-speaking language, I say: Oh, that's Jay Zed.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: This was a taco party I found through the Eat With website. I paid 40 bucks to go to the home of two fun-loving Latinas. They have a great apartment, filled with art, just across from the Brooklyn Museum. And as soon as their guests arrived they made it a point to shove rum drinks into their hands.</p>
    <p>Katrin Bergmann came all the way from Frankfurt, Germany. She was part of a gaggle of German tourists that turned up, because she'd seen a segment on Eat With on German TV called "How to Survive in New York."</p>
    <p>KATRIN BERGMANN: We thought we wanted to do something different from a normal tourist, tour. And we wanted to talk to real people who live here. And so we have real Brooklyn people around us, and that's...</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And Germans.</p>
    <p>BERGMANN: And Germans, yes.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: The hosts, Glori Linares and Victoria Delgado, keep shuttling between the dining room and kitchen, frying up empanadillas stuffed with Oaxaca cheese. They're both vivacious, easy-going, perfectly suited to the job of hosting a bunch of strangers and dealing with unforeseen circumstances, like an episode last summer.</p>
    <p>GLORI LINARES: And all of a sudden, we hear a thump on the floor.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: She passed out?</p>
    <p>VICTORIA DELGADO: She did pass out, and we freaked out a little bit, not that much.</p>
    <p>LINARES: After that, she was, like, really, like, she was fine.</p>
    <p>DELGADO: She just fainted.</p>
    <p>LINARES: She just fainted.</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: Because it was a hot day, and the lady went a little heavy on the rum. But I actually went for two dinners, and one was nothing like the other.</p>
    <p>RASANATH DASA: If ambition is tied into authenticity, there's nothing more powerful than that.</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: Here, the setting was the East Village, in Manhattan. And the host, a Wall-Street-banker-turned-Hindu monk.</p>
    <p>DASA: The problem is when it gets rooted in narcissism. Then it takes on a very different form.</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: We sat in Rasanath Dasa's apartment, discussing authenticity and the pure life, capitalism and self-denial, all the while sipping water and having what might be some of the best soup I have had. If this all sounds a little strange, a little surreal it was, and completely mesmerizing.</p>
    <p>Vipin Goyal co-founded Side Tour, the site where you can sign up Rasanath Dasa's dinner. He said the company takes pains to find people who are more than just good cooks.</p>
    <p>VIPIN GOYAL: It was people who we thought would be really remarkable for other people to get to know.</p>
    <p>VENUGOPAL: The idea seems to be succeeding. Side Tour says some of its hosts make anywhere from 10 to $50,000 a year. And in the fall, the company was bought by Groupon. Meanwhile, Eat With is adding dining experiences in dozens of countries. Not that anyone's expecting home dining to replace restaurants, at least not in New York. After all, there are only so many New Yorkers who can cook, and are willing to play host in their tiny apartments. But that doesn't make the experience any less fun.</p>
    <p>BERGMANN: Cheers.</p>
