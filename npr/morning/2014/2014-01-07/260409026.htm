<h1> "Colo. Marijuana Merchants Forced To Deal Mostly In Cash" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>And today's last word in business today is: cash only.</p>
    <p>Colorado's retailers may be allowed to sell marijuana now, but under federal law, the state's banks cannot knowingly do business with them.</p>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>This has forced marijuana merchants in the state to operate almost solely in cash. Denver's city council, not happy. They called yesterday for Washington to change the law.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: But even then, Colorado marijuana shop owners would still have a plastic problem. Official Visa, MasterCard and American Express rules prohibit the use of their debit and credit cards to purchase pot.</p>
    <p>GREENE: Visa, it's everywhere you want to be, I guess, except if you're in the marijuana business. That's the business news on MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm David Greene.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
