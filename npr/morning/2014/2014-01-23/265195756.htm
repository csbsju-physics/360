    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>And now, an update on an Olympic athlete we met Monday on this program. Kris Freeman became one of America's top cross-country skiers, even as he was dealing with Type 1 diabetes.</p>
    <p>Last spring, Freeman was cut from the national U.S. ski team. He lost a lot of his funding and his health insurance, so Freeman skied on his own this season. Yesterday, some good news: Top-ranked Freeman was named to the 2014 Olympic team, and he's off to Sochi.</p>
