    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: In a securities filing, the maker of computers and printers confirmed that it will cut 5,000 more jobs this year than it originally estimated. That would bring to 34,000 the number of jobs the company is planning to cut worldwide by October.</p>
    <p>The cuts are part of a restructuring plan formed in 2012, aimed at stemming losses caused by declining sales. Hewlett-Packard is based in the U.S. but it has about 300,000 employees internationally.</p>
