<h1> "Official Trademark: Cronut" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne hoping you're not thinking of calling your newest creation in the kitchen a Cronut with a C, because that has already been taken. The trademark was officially registered this week to describe the cross between a croissant and a donut that's lured New Yorkers into long lines for months now.</p>
    <p>The trademark does not affect pastry chefs selling Dossants, Crodoughs, Cronut, Croillers and Craynuts. All of which, by the way, really exist.</p>
    <p>It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
