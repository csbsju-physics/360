<h1> "'Omaha' Businesses Back Peyton Manning's Foundation" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business is...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTBALL GAME BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>PEYTON MANNING: Omaha!</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Yes, Omaha. It's more than just the biggest city in Nebraska. It's also a signal that Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning barked out repeatedly last Sunday during a playoff game against the San Diego Chargers.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTBALL GAME BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>MANNING: Omaha!</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED BROADCASTER: Denver.</p>
    <p>MANNING: Omaha! Omaha!</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Well what, exactly, does Omaha mean? Well, since it is signaling something about the play that's about to start, and since Manning may well be using that signal again, he's a little elusive.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)</p>
    <p>MANNING: It's a run play, but it could be a pass play...</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MANNING: ...or a play action pass, depending on the wind, which way we're going, and the jerseys that we're wearing.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: That makes it clear. This Sunday, Omaha will mean cold, hard cash. Several Omaha-based companies have put their money on Omaha during this weekend's conference championship game.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Every time Manning shouts Omaha this weekend, the businesses will donate $500 to Peyton Manning's foundation for at-risk children.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Think of it like a drinking game, except nobody gets hurt. Let's start now. It's MORNING EDITION, from Omaha News. I'm Steve Omaha.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And I'm Renee Montomaha.</p>
