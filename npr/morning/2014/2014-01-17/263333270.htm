<h1> "Would-Be Burglar Unlocks Door But It Won't Budge" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. This next story would be hard to believe except the source for it claims he has security video. Joe Lynn owns the Shambles bar in Chicago. He tells a local website a man tried to break in at 6:43 a.m. The burglar was technically adept - he disabled a lock. But the video shows he could not open the door.</p>
    <p>He just kept pulling and pulling. He finally gave up pulling and just had to walk away, apparently never having noticed the sign that said: Push. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
