<h1> "Safety Group Sues Buckyballs Founder In Product Recall Case" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>A federal government agency has taken and unusual step. They are suing the founder of a toy company over product safety concerns - and recently, he filed a countersuit. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says Buckyballs - if you're not familiar with them - these are clusters of magnetized balls, are a serious danger to children.</p>
    <p>Ilya Marritz from member station WNYC has the story.</p>
    <p>ILYA MARRITZ, BYLINE: Call them brainteasers, amusements, or gifts for dad, just don't call these little magnetic beads a toy.</p>
    <p>CRAIG ZUCKER: Well, first of all, it was never a toy, so I wouldn't use that word; it was always an adult desktop gift item.</p>
    <p>MARRITZ: That's Craig Zucker, CEO of the now-defunct company that sold Buckyballs.</p>
    <p>What exactly is a Buckyball? It's a high-power nickel-plated magnetic bead.</p>
    <p>ZUCKER: And they're really about -I would say - the size of a BB, is what I'd compare it to.</p>
    <p>MARRITZ: Starting in 2009, Craig Zucker's Buckyballs started to appear in gift shops, in packs of 125 or more. They quickly became a hit, complete with YouTube videos.</p>
