<h1> "Bad Penmanship Leaves Would-Be Bank Robber Without Cash" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep with a reminder to write legibly. A man walked into a bank in Antioch, California. At the counter, he gave the teller a note but she couldn't read the guy's penmanship. She called over her manager for help. Deciphering this communication took so long that the man who had written the note finally walked out of the door in frustration.</p>
    <p>It was only afterward that the bank staff figure out the guy was trying to rob the place.</p>
    <p>You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
