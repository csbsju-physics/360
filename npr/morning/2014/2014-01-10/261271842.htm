    <p>GREENE: China might have just dislodged the United States from a position it held for decades as the world's top trading nation. The latest Chinese figures put the value of its overall trade at $4.6 trillion last year.</p>
    <p>The United States will release its own 2013 data next month. But for the first 11 months of the year, its trade was worth $3.5 trillion.</p>
