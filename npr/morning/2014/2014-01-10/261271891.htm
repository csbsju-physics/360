<h1> "Steeler Fan Goes To Court Over Blown Call " </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. You want to know why Pittsburgh Steelers fans are angry these days? Well, referees blew a call that may have let San Diego into the playoffs instead of the Steelers. In this litigious society, Steelers fan Daniel Spuck decided to act. He filed a motion asking for an injunction to keep San Diego out of the playoffs. Spuck has his own legal problems - he filed suit from a corrections facility. I'm giving him long odds.</p>
    <p>I will say that ref's call made this Steelers fan nearly drive off the road. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
