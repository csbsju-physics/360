    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne with a news of a job opportunity in sunny South Florida, paying $25 an hour: Crocodile handler. The job involves responding to complaints about nuisance crocs. A state official tells the South Florida Sun Sentinel it's looking for someone who is low Key - not just calm while relocating crocodiles but also in handling those homeowners who are upset to discover they're living in a crocodile habitat and the crocs will stay. It is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.</p>
