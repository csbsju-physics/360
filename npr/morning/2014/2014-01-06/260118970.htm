    <p>GREENE: The Senate is set to vote on Janet Yellen's nomination today. She is President Obama's pick to succeed Ben Bernanke as the chairman of the Federal Reserve. If Yellen is confirmed as expected, she'll take over for Bernanke at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Yellen would become the first female chief in the bank's 100 year history, joining a handful of women heading central banks around the world.</p>
