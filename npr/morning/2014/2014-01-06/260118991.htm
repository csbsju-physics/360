<h1> "Australian Olympic Athletes Face Social Media Ban" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>OK, our Last Word In Business is ski tweeting. Is that really a thing?</p>
    <p>Well, the Australian Olympic Committee has placed a social media ban on its athletes at the Sochi Winter Games - coming up, in Russia. Tweeting, Facebooking and Snap-chatting join partying as officially forbidden activities.</p>
    <p>Winter athletes can thank their summer colleagues for the new social media ban. The country's Olympic committee came up with the rule after a disappointing showing by the Australian swim team during the London Summer Games.</p>
    <p>A recent review of that team's 2012 Olympic performance suggests excessive drinking, bullying and yes, social media were major distractions ,and kept the swimmers from bringing home multiple golds as expected.</p>
    <p>But some Aussie athletes headed for Sochi for the Winter Games have already turned their noses up at the rule, expressing their feelings - where else? - on Twitter.</p>
    <p>That's the business news on Morning Edition, from NPR News. I'm David Greene.</p>
