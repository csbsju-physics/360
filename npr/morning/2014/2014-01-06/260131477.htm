<h1> "23 Years Later, Message In A Bottle Answered" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm David Greene. Zoe Averianov was 10 years old, riding a ferry from England to Belgium. She tossed a bottle into the sea with a letter about her love of the flute and hamsters. She asked for someone to write her back; 23 years later, someone did. Zoe, who's 33 now, heard from a Dutch couple who found her bottle off the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
    <p>They say they plan to keep Zoe's letter on their piano. To send their response, the couple opted for a quicker method of delivery - the postal service. You're listening to MORNING EDITION.</p>
