    <p>And our last word in business is: Beating the odds.</p>
    <p>Quicken Loans says it will pay $1 billion if you do.</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>The Detroit-based finance wants your attention if you're one of the people who filled out an NCAA Tournament bracket. You can now get a $1 billion prize if you correctly pick every single game.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: The company has offered all sorts of details about how it will pay this price, and it says Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is backing the offer.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Well, let's just think about that for a minute. Warren Buffett is not known for blowing billion-dollar bets.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: Turned out the odds of correctly picking every single NCAA Tournament game are more than nine quintillion to one. Odds are pretty good that Quicken Loans will get all the attention for its promotion for free.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: In unrelated news, MORNING EDITION is offering $1 trillion to the first person who danced Gangnam Style on Jupiter.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: We may also give a price to the first person who is able who counts to nine quintillion.</p>
    <p>That's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
