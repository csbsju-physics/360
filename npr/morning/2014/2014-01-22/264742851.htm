<h1> "West Virginians Have Renewed Worries About Water Quality" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>And while Californians worry about air quality, West Virginians worry about water quality, again.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, a chemical spill into the Elk River left 300,000 residents with contaminated water supply. The water was tainted with and MCMH, a chemical used to wash coal.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: That pollutant was cleared from the river and tap water declared safe to drink. But these reports of clean water may be exaggerated.</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: A different chemical called PPH also leaked from the tank. Officials are just now learning about the PPH and so they never tested for its presence in the local water supply.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: The water company is now testing for PPH. Although, authorities contend the chemical has low toxicity.</p>
