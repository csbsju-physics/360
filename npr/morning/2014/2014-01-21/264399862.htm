<h1> "Union Angered By Postal Service Deal With Staples" </h1>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>The American Postal Workers Union is fighting back against a deal that puts U.S. Postal Service counters inside Staples stores. The Postal Service is facing a deficit and increased competition, so it's developing retail partnerships with companies like Staples.</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>The Postal Service says this adds to convenience, since people could buy stamps and mail packages while shopping, even while the regular post office is closed. The controversy comes because the counters are staffed by Staples employees instead of postal workers.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: The Postal Workers Union wants the counters run by its members. Union leaders wrote a letter to store managers reading, quote, "Only U.S. Postal Service postal employees are sworn to uphold the sanctity of the mail." They had that message hand-delivered.</p>
