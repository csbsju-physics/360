<h1> "Business Major Hopes Ads Will Pay Off His Student Loans" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep with best wishes to Alex Benda. He graduates this spring from the University of Michigan at Flint. He's a business major and he's making a business of his graduation. Mr. Benda says he is selling advertising space on his graduation cap. He wants 300 bucks for an ad that's one square inch. It may be hard to see an ad of that size from the audience. But if he could sell 100 ads, he would pay off his student loans.</p>
