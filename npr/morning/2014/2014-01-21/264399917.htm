    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>NPR's business news begins with the world's richest people.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>INSKEEP: In particular, a focus here on the 85 richest people in the world. Those 85 rich people have a combined wealth of $1.7 trillion, we're told, which is the equivalent to the amount of wealth shared by the poorest half of the entire world population.</p>
    <p>The new findings were part of a study released yesterday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The same study also calculates that the world's richest 1 percent - so a slightly larger group now - controls almost 50 percent of global wealth.</p>
    <p>The report also says that tax rates for the richest people have fallen in most developed countries since the 1970s.</p>
