    <p>And our last word in business this morning: Cool Runnings.</p>

    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: That's a line from the movie about the Jamaican bobsled team that went to the Olympics in 1988</p>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>The heroes of the movie "Cool Runnings" raised money by singing in the streets and setting up a kissing. But they did not have the Internet.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Fans of this year's Jamaican bobsled team do. They appealed for money online - crowdfunding, as it's called - raising more than $100,000.</p>
    <p>Maybe that generosity got Jamaica's Olympic Council in the giving mood because the council said it will pay the bobsled team's travel expenses. The teams says it can now save the money raised online to spend in non-Olympic years.</p>
