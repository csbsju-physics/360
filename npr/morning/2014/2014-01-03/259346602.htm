    <p>NPR's business news begins with securing cyberspace.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>GREENE: All right, we're talking about a $1 billion deal here. The cybersecurity company FireEye has bought Mandiant. Mandiant gained some fame last year. They exposed a secretive branch of the Chinese military that was hacking into the computer networks of over 100 multinational companies.</p>
    <p>These two companies appear to be a good marriage. FireEye detects and prevents cyber threats. Mandiant's main expertise is stepping in and plugging the hole when there is a security breach.</p>
    <p>The merger brought a big jump in FireEye's stock price in trading yesterday.</p>
