<h1> "British Law Prohibits Intelligence Officers From Speeding" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Greene, David Greene. Just doing my James Bond there. A lot of things in those movies not so realistic. Could those gadgets really do that? Is any man really that suave? Well, here's a reality check that you might not expect. Actual British law prohibits intelligence officers from speeding.</p>
    <p>In other words, a real life Bond could be pulled over for driving over 30 miles an hour in a city. This is changing now - if spies are willing to take a high-speed driving course. Aston Martin not required. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
