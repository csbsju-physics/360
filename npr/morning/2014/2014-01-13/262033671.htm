<h1> "Mile Marker 420 Repeatedly Stolen In Colorado" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep.</p>
    <p>Colorado officials might have seen this coming. The state legalized marijuana. The number 420 is associated with marijuana culture, and so it was time to protect Mile Marker 420. The sign has been repeatedly stolen from I-70; it's a rare find since most interstates are not long enough to need a Mile 420 sign. Officials hope they've now secured the highway. The mile 420 sign has been replaced by a new one, reading: Mile 419.99.</p>
