<h1> "Butter Consumption Jumps To 40-Year High" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>And our last word in business is: Spread the butter.</p>
    <p>Maybe some of you are slathering butter on a piece of toast right now or dropping a pat of butter into your oatmeal. You're not alone. Butter consumption is at a 40-year high - and here's an image I almost hesitate to offer - the average American - according to some estimates - eats 5.6 pounds of butter every year.</p>
    <p>RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: </p>
    <p>That's a 25 percent increase over the past decade. Its jump in popularity is due to an overall trend towards natural foods, and a rejection of processed ones.</p>
    <p>And the FDA recently banned trans fats, the hydrogenated oils found in many imitation butter products.</p>
    <p>GREENE: But even with the rise of foodies and state fair butter sculptures, we're not even close to the per-capita consumption of the 1930s, which was over 18 pounds of butter a year per person. Why did it make me...</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: That's a lot toast.</p>
    <p>GREENE: I don't want to have any butter now for days.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Mashed potatoes.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: I don't know, it sounds good to me, David.</p>
    <p>GREENE: OK. OK.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: Butter...</p>
    <p>GREENE: More power to you. That's the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm David Greene.</p>
    <p>MONTAGNE: And I'm Renee Montagne.</p>
