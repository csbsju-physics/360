<h1> "Super Bowl Gambling Includes 'Gimmick' Bets" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. The Denver Broncos are a two and a half point favorite to win the Super Bowl, but you didn't need to know that in order to gamble. The Seattle Times reports that one-third of Super Bowl gambling now consists of gimmick bets. You can bet on the number of times Peyton Manning says Omaha. Or on whether Renee Fleming makes a mistake in the "National Anthem," or even the color of Gatorade that is dumped on the winning coach after the game.</p>
    <p>Ten to one says green. It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
