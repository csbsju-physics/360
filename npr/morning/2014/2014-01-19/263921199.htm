<h1> "Piracy Dips To A New Low On The High Seas" </h1>
    <p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p>
    <p>We're going to turn our attention now to piracy. There have been a string of pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia over the past few years. One was the basis of an Oscar-nominated film starring Tom Hanks.</p>
    <p>But now, an organization that monitors crime at sea says piracy has suddenly dropped. According to the International Maritime Bureau, there were 264 incidents around the globe recorded last year, which is a 40 percent decrease from its peak in 2011. The decline has to do with several factors. The organization says there are more armed guards on vessels and more international naval forces patrolling the waters off of Somalia, which accounted for most of the attacks. A stronger central government in Somalia has also cracked down on pirates.</p>
    <p>But piracy remains lucrative and popular in other parts of the world. So if you are on the high seas, where should you avoid sailing your yacht? Indonesia and Nigeria.</p>
