<h1> "Federal Aviation Administration Grounds Lakemaid Beer" </h1>
    <p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded Lakemaid Beer. The Wisconsin brewery wants to do what Amazon promoted on "60 Minutes" - delivery by drone. Lakemaid had a more specific plan: send beer to the shacks of ice fishermen. They showed the delivery in a video but the FAA banned their testing, saying it breaks four or five regulations.</p>
    <p>Lakemaid replies its deliveries are not to a crowded neighborhood but to a frozen lake. What could go wrong? It's MORNING EDITION.</p>
