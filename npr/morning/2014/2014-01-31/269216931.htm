<h1> "Lawmakers Bet Local Cuisine On Super Bowl Outcome" </h1>
    <p>DAVID GREENE, HOST: </p>
    <p>Good morning, I'm David Greene.</p>
    <p>Lawmakers are betting local cuisine on the Super Bowl. If Denver wins, the losers from Washington State will send apples, wine and smoked salmon from the great Northwest. If Seattle wins, Colorado will send beers, steak and whiskey. Colorado Congressman Cory Gardner said he'll also throw in Rocky Mountain oysters. I had to look those up. They're not oysters. They are part of a calf, specifically, a male calf. Another name for them, Montana Tender Groins - deep fried bits of-what make a bull a bull.</p>
