<h1> "Michael Chabon: Charmed by a Dashing Brigadier" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, host: </p>
    <p>Our series, "You Must Read This," features authors talking about the books they love. Today, we're going to hear from Michael Chabon. He wrote "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay," among other things. He recommends a lesser book known by the man who created Sherlock Holmes. </p>
    <p>Mr. MICHAEL CHABON (Author, "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"): By 1893, as you might know, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was heartily sick of Sherlock Holmes. So he arranged to have his great creation tangle with a murderous arch-villain named Professor James Moriarty beside a high waterfall on a convenient Swiss Alp. You may also know that 10 years later, Conan Doyle was obliged by financial pressures to reveal to a grateful world that Holmes had merely staged his own death. </p>
    <p>But did you know that in between gleefully killing off and somewhat reluctantly reviving him, Arthur Conan Doyle created another great fictional character, one who easily rivals Holmes, if not for intelligence, then for heroism, bravery and dash? A character who exceeds Holmes in the one trait in which the great detective, by his own admission, was always deficient - a rich and lovable humanity. This hero, a handsome, charming and resourceful cavalry officer serving in the Grand Army of Napoleon, has only one tragic flaw, though in his own eyes, of course, it is his glory and his single greatest advantage in life - he is a Frenchman. </p>
    <p>His name is Brigadier Etienne Gerard, and he starred in 17 short stories that Conan Doyle wrote, with a palpable sense of liberation, after pushing Holmes off that Alpine ledge. In their day they were almost as popular as the Holmes stories, but I have to confess that even though I'm a lifelong Sherlockian, I had never heard of the good brigadier. In its pages you will find adventure, action, romance, love and self-sacrifice, hair's-breadth escape and reckless courage, gallantry, panache and a droll, backhand humor that rivals PG Wodehouse. Etienne Gerard, like all Frenchmen ever conceived of by Englishmen, is vain, conceited, self-important and blind to anything that does not touch directly on his honor. </p>
    <p>He is also tender, affectionate and sensitive. Conan Doyle placed himself imaginatively into the heart, soul and boots of a French cavalry officer, a man sworn to fight and kill Englishmen. With humor, affection and real insight into a soldier's life, Conan Doyle bridges the gap between him and his dashing popinjay of a hero. His artistry bridges the gap between our century and his, between a world lit by torches and whale-oil lamps and our own, between a time when war was still conducted face to face and our dehumanized era of collateral damage and target-rich environments. </p>
    <p>That act of imaginative sympathy is the requirement and blessing of literature, and it calls forth a similar act in the mind of the reader. It's one that few writers have ever pulled off more touchingly and winningly than in these unjustly forgotten tales by a great master. </p>
    <p>NORRIS: Michael Chabon is the author of "The Yiddish Policemen's Union" and "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay." </p>
