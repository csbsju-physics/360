<h1> "S.C. Primary Update from the Huckabee Camp" </h1>
    <p>ANDREA SEABROOK, host: </p>
    <p>And now to Audie Cornish, who's also at South Carolina at the Convention Center in downtown Columbia, where Mike Huckabee has his headquarters. </p>
    <p>Audie, what's the mood there? </p>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH: I think the mood is just as cautious as it is over at McCain's place. Essentially, the campaign managers here are repeatedly bringing up the bad weather, I think maybe downplaying expectations because some of worst weather was in the areas of the state that where the most Republican, the most conservative and the most evangelical. </p>
    <p>SEABROOK: Audie, what did you hear from voters this week? I know you spoke to many of them. </p>
    <p>CORNISH: Well, there's definitely a divide in terms of you have your evangelical vote, but that's not a monolithic vote. There are folks behind the sort of Bob Jones University people, and fundamentalists who back Mitt Romney. You have the Southern Baptists of there's more than half a million in the state. And they obviously are tends to support a Baptist like Mike Huckabee. So it wasn't obvious which way these votes would go, even though it would seem that Huckabee obviously has a natural constituency here. </p>
    <p>SEABROOK: Now, do we have any word that Mike Huckabee will be speaking at all tonight? </p>
    <p>CORNISH: He will be speaking, but we don't know when. And I think that's because it's so close right now. We're not hearing a lot from the campaign about exit polls. They're not really wanting to get to details to talk about it. </p>
    <p>SEABROOK: It's a nail-biter. NPR's Audie Cornish in Columbia, South Carolina. Thanks very much, Audie. </p>
    <p>CORNISH: Thank you. </p>
