    <p>From NPR News, this ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.</p>

    <p>And Scott, Governor Romney has spent a lot of time in Iowa; how did he spent this final day of the campaign?</p>
    <p>SCOTT HORSLEY: He spent this morning visiting with supporters at a couple of Des Moines area businesses. And this evening, as folks were heading into their caucuses, he stopped by three different caucus locations. The last one, just about 15 minutes ago, he has - it's a very close race here in Iowa and he's trying to reach as many voters as he can as the moment arrives for them to express a preference.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: And there's been quite a battle of words between Governor Romney and his main rival there in Iowa, former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who has a big following among the large evangelical base there.</p>
    <p>HORSLEY: That's right. One of the things that the Romney camp has been talking about as they try to perhaps lower expectations a little bit is to keep an eye on the evangelical turnout. As you mentioned, the evangelicals tend to sway in favor of Mike Huckabee. And the Romney camp has said that if there is a large evangelical turnout at tonight's caucuses, it would be very difficult for Governor Romney to finish first here. That said, Romney himself wasn't making any predictions today when he spoke at the Kum and Go headquarters in Des Moines. He quoted Yogi Berra, and said, it's tough to make predications especially where the future is concerned.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Okay, that's NPR's Scott Horsley in West Des Moines at the headquarters for Mitt Romney.</p>
