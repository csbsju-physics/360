<h1> "Republican Caucuses Explained" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>A Republican caucus in Iowa is less complicated. Just ask Ed Fravel who's hosting one in his home in Plymouth County this evening.</p>
    <p>ED FRAVEL: Well, they come, they sign in. We're going give - depending on the amount of people here - we're going to give them each so much time to tell which person they like and why they like them. We then pass out a written ballot, go count the ballots. And then we have to turn those in, of course, to the state Republican Party.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: All in? Nobody's eliminated? No...</p>
    <p>FRAVEL: Nobody's eliminated.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: So yours is a pretty straightforward caucus?</p>
    <p>FRAVEL: It's a pretty straightforward caucus.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: You're not at all attracted to the idea of, you know, second preferences counting of some candidates who are eliminated, not doing very well?</p>
    <p>FRAVEL: No.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: No? You stand by the Republican caucus, I see.</p>
    <p>FRAVEL: Yes, we do.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Well, Mr. Fravel, thank you very much for talking with us today.</p>
    <p>FRAVEL: All right, thank you.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: That's Ed Fravel of Plymouth County, Iowa. He's hosting a Republican caucus this evening in his home north of Sioux City.</p>
