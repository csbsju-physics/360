<h1> "Iowa Caucuses: Checking in on Polling" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>And again, with about a third of the precincts reporting in Iowa on the Democratic side, John Edwards, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, each at 32 percent down to fractions of a percentage-point difference. But we're going to hear about the entrance polling now with Andy Kohut. Robert?</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>Right. Andy Kohut of the Pew Research Center is back with us. And Andy, you've been looking at the entrance polls from Iowa. These are pretty big samples or rather there's still a lot of room for error here. But first, on the Republican side, what are you seeing?</p>
    <p>BLOCK: The other thing that's really surprising and interesting on the Republican side is that there's a big gender gap. Huckabee is running two to one over Romney among women. And they're running dead even among men. And that again may reflect religiosity. Religiosity seems to be so much the pattern in the Republican race.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: The - as you say, the sample that the - of the Republican entrance polls find a very large number of evangelical Christians, conservative Christians, and Mike Huckabee does very well with them. And he's doing very well in the exit polls.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: He's doing very well in the exit polls. He has a very significant lead over Romney. Now, you know, we have to take these entrance polls with a grain of salt. It's not like an election. But he has a nice lead...</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And the Democratic side, what do you see?</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Four years ago, only 45 percent of the entrance poll respondents on the Democratic side were first-timers. And Obama is doing quite nicely among them. He's doing well among independent voters. And he - in the entrance poll at least, going in, he holds a nice - held a nice lead over both Edwards and...</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And Hillary Clinton?</p>
    <p>BLOCK: ...Hillary Clinton. Yeah.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Melissa?</p>
    <p>BLOCK: He also just seems to be doing very well, Barack Obama, among people on a number of issues; people who think the economy is a big issue, the war in Iraq, health care. He does well across the board.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Health care is Mrs. Clinton's issue, though.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And you're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.</p>
