<h1> "Iraq to Restore Former Baath Party Followers" </h1>
    <p>ANDREA SEABROOK, host: </p>
    <p>From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. </p>
    <p>Iraq's parliament finally passed the long-awaited measure today to ease restrictions on members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party. Washington has pushed Iraq Shiite-led government to pass a new de-Baathification law. It's hoped this will bring more Sunnis into the political process and ease sectarian tensions. </p>
    <p>NPR's Anne Garrels has this report from Baghdad. </p>
    <p>ANNE GARRELS: During his visit to the south of here in Bahrain, President Bush had immediate praise. </p>
    <p>President GEORGE W. BUSH: It's an important step toward reconciliation. It's an important sign that the leaders of that country understand they must work together to meet the aspirations of the Iraqi people. </p>
    <p>GARRELS: Haider al-Abadi, an aide to the Iraqi prime minister, said the new law provides balance, protecting the rights of victims while benefiting innocent members of the Baath Party. </p>
    <p>Mr. HAIDER AL-ABADI (Iraqi Prime Minister's Aide): We're trying to legalize the whole process. Now, it is a proper Iraqi law, which was judiciary, which would oversee the whole process. So this is a major departure from the previous law. It is a success for Iraq and a success for the new Iraq. </p>
    <p>GARRELS: The U.S. had promoted de-Baathification in the early days of the U.S. occupation, but later claimed the de-Baathification commission it helped form had gone way too far, often acting capriciously. </p>
    <p>The new law still bans the most senior Baath Party members from government work. But senior Baathists will now be allowed to claim their pensions. Those who will benefit most are tens of thousands of midlevel Baathists who were fired. </p>
    <p>The old law was ostensibly designed to give Iraq a fresh start by keeping members of the old regime's political party out of jobs where they could wield influence. But it also resulted in gutted ministries and helped fuel the Sunni insurgency. </p>
    <p>Many of these former Baathists will get their jobs back. </p>
    <p>An educator for three decades, Weedad al-Latiya was fired as a school principal because of her Baath Party rank. </p>
    <p>Last year, she told NPR Iraq lost people of great experience even though they had not committed any crimes. </p>
    <p>Ms. WEEDAD AL-LATIYA (Member, Baath Party): (Through translator) You know, it was mandatory to be Baathist if you were a teacher. Otherwise, you couldn't get a job. </p>
    <p>GARRELS: For the past five years, despite repeated promises of a reprieve, she has received no pension. </p>
    <p>Reached by phone today, Weedad was sitting on the dark because there was no electricity. At the news, she laughed with resignation, not with joy. </p>
    <p>Ms. Al-LATIYA: (Speaking in foreign language) </p>
    <p>GARRELS: She says she'll believe there are really changes when they're actually enforced and she sees her money. </p>
    <p>Under the new law, Mohammed Ali Mohssen, a former Baathist and official in the transportation ministry, can return to government work but not in his former senior position. </p>
    <p>Mr. MOHAMMED ALI MOHSSEN: (Speaking in foreign language) </p>
    <p>GARRELS: Also reached by phone, he says he returned from exile hoping for more. And he, too, fears the government will not implement even the limited improvements. </p>
    <p>The bill passed today was the product of long, hard wrangling. An early draft offered former Baathists immunity from prosecution after a three-month period. Shiite and Kurdish lawmakers protested that was too lenient. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: (Spoken foreign language) </p>
    <p>GARRELS: Some Sunni members of parliament like Mustafa al-Hiti say the final version is too severe, and in key places dangerously vague, opening the door for abuse. </p>
    <p>This is just the first of many reform measures the U.S. has long pushed Baghdad to pass. But so far, a lack of consensus on key issues like power sharing with the regions has created a stalemate. </p>
    <p>The next thing up in parliament is actually a debate on a new flag. Earlier efforts have failed. Kurdistan has pointedly refused to fly the old Saddam-era banner, underscoring the Kurds growing separation from the rest of Iraq. </p>
    <p>A new design removes Baath Party insignia and instead of God is great, scrawled in Saddam's handwriting, it's now spelled out in standard script, and right in the middle is a yellow circle signifying Kurdistan. </p>
    <p>That will be an interesting debate. </p>
