<h1> "Nevada Caucus Explainer" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>A footnote now on how the Nevada caucuses will work. </p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, host: </p>
    <p>For the Democrats, the Nevada Delegate Selection Plan and Affirmative Action Plan is 65 pages long. In essence it says, this will be a lot like Iowa. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Democrats gather at 11 tomorrow morning. Once again, viability is key. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Caucus goers will break into groups to indicate their preferred candidates. Groups without enough people will be declared nonviable and their members will have to go join the group of a different candidate. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Now, the Republicans will get together earlier at nine in the morning. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: They speak on behalf of their favorites candidates and then vote by secret ballot. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: By caucusing, participants are actually selecting delegates to the county convention, who will go on to elect state delegates, who'll go on to the national convention to pick a presidential nominee. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And you can read more about the issues and politics at stake in Nevada's primaries at npr.org/elections. </p>
