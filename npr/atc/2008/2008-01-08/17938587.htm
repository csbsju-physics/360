    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>There are no returns in yet from New Hampshire, but we think it's safe to declare the official word of this week in the presidential campaign.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>

    <p>NORRIS: Change is coming to America.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Washington needs fundamental, top to bottom change.</p>

    <p>SIEGEL: Courtesy of Merriam-Webster, vote for the candidate of alteration, modification, variation, transfiguration, rectification.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Rectification? Okay. How about transformation or metamorphosis or the candidate of refashioning, revamping, reworking? How about just difference?</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And from Roget, the candidate of shift, of substitution, transformation, transmutation. Maybe not transmutation.</p>
