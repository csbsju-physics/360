    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>We do a lot of obituaries on this program, and they're usually about people who have at least a few mentions in the media. But this next remembrance, which was sent to us today, is about someone who was neither rich nor famous, but she still offers important lessons, says essayists Melody Moezzi.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: If only to have the privilege of another minute in her company, it is worth my every effort on Earth to assure that like her, I, too, find my way to paradise.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Melody Moezzi is a writer, activist, attorney and author.</p>
