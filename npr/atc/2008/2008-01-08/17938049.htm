<h1> "Sarkozy Love Affair Fuels Growth of Public Criticism" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: (Speaking in foreign language).</p>
    <p>ELEANOR BEARDSLEY: Unidentified Woman: (Speaking in foreign language).</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: Are you going to marry Carla Bruni and when, a journalist asked.</p>
    <p>NICOLAS SARKOZY: (Speaking in foreign language).</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: How do I answer that, said Sarkozy, flashing a broad grin.</p>
    <p>SARKOZY: (Speaking in foreign language)</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: But Sarkozy's complete change of style - mixing his private life with his public life - may be more than some French people can handle, says analyst Dominic Moisi.</p>
    <p>DOMINIQUE MOISI: There's always something happening in the new Sarkozian republic. I think that's a little too much for many Frenchmen who are accusing the president from neglecting their problems and from leading a lifestyle that is too much in contrast with the difficulties of their own private lives.</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: At the counter of Le Mirabeau cafe near the Seine River, Jerome Barron(ph) is enjoying a draught beer after work. Barron says he doesn't think Sarkozy's relationship is directly related to his drop in popularity, but it's what he calls the president's permanent show that is beginning to wear thin.</p>
    <p>JEROME BARRON: (Speaking in foreign language).</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: He's too Americanized. We have an image of a more statesman-like, reserved president, not someone who acts like a tycoon, Barron says. He goes too fast, we French want gradual change. So it's his image that's a bit troubling.</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: For NPR News, I'm Eleanor Beardsley in Paris.</p>
