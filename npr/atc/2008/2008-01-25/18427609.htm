<h1> "A Restaurant for the Birds Welcomes All" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>As winter continues, homeowners put more effort into feeding their feathered neighbors. But essayist Julie Zickefoose realized her bird feeder might be attracting birds who are looking for more than just a few seeds.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: When we feed birds, spread seeds on the ground and pour them into various feeders, we expect finches and chickadees to show up. Here in southeast Ohio, a good snow may bring 70 northern cardinals to our feeders, stunning testament to the ecological impact of our little seed restaurant.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, though, a customer swaggers into our vegan bird restaurant, plops down and orders a steak, rare. The waitress, in her table-waiting uniform of flannel pajamas and rubber boots, is taken aback. She puts down a bucket of seed she was carrying. I'm sorry, sir. We don't serve meat here. That's all right, he grunts. I'll get it myself.</p>
    <p>Perched on the crossbar of our feeding station, he stares me down, this pint-sized sharp-shinned hawk. He showed up here in mid-October, and he clearly likes what we're serving - goldfinch, junco, titmouse. His back is brown, broadly spangled with bright white spots, his breast streaked with teardrops of rust. His eyes are yellow. His wicked, needle-tipped feet are the color of grapefruit rind. He likes it here.</p>
    <p>About a month ago, I heard a tremendous thunk on my studio window, and looked up to see the hawk go cartwheeling off to land clumsily in our pines. I didn't see him anymore that day, but he was back the next, leaving little crimson piles of cardinal feathers on the ground.</p>
    <p>Now the hawk has settled into a routine. He bombs around the corner of the house like a brown arrow. Startled, the flocks fly up from the feeders and ground. And sometimes, a panicked bird or two hits the windows in our house. Then, he has his pick of them.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I've had three other sharp-shinned hawks learn to use our windows to their advantage in just this way. One could almost classify it as tool using, if a sheet of glass could be called a tool. At the very least, it's a hawkish innovation.</p>
    <p>All over the country, sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks are becoming feeding-station regulars along with chickadees, jays and juncos. Like it or not, we're feeding them too. Seventy cardinals festooning a single backyard is an undeniably beautiful sight, enough to make a seed-toting waitress proud. But there's nothing natural about it. But for my bird restaurant, there might be one-tenth that number. The quick talon, the hard yellow glare of the sharp-shinned hawk, the rush of panicked wings, and the drift of plucked feathers beneath the birch - that's natural, a balance to the imbalance I've created.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Essayist Julie Zickefoose writes and paints on Indigo Hill, a private sanctuary near Whipple, Ohio. She's the author of "Letters from Eden," and tells us she'd rather paint a hawk than a cardinal any day.</p>
