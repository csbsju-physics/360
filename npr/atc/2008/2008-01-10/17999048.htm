<h1> "Letters: N.H. Primary, Young Tailor, Merle Haggard" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>Thursday is the day we read from your e-mail.</p>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>And politics dominated the news this week. So we'll start with some comments on our political coverage.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: I expected better review, writes John Kramer(ph) of Portland, Oregon, I was quite disappointed in your coverage of the New Hampshire primary. From listening to it, one would think that Hillary Clinton had a landslide victory despite Barack Obama garnering as many delegates as she did. It just shows that what the media reports is as important as what actually happens.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Nora Burnham(ph) of Butte City, California was unhappy with some of our analysis of the New Hampshire primary. She writes, I found to believe that Obama's votes were due solely to upscale voters - Whole Foods kind of people, and that Hillary's vote were casted by less-educated, Wal-Mart going folks. I am college educated, and I have intended to vote for Hillary since she announced her candidacy because she is a very intelligent woman who's going to make history. Oh, and by the way, I also shop at Whole Foods.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Stephen Hughes(ph) of North Bend, Washington didn't like our stories about Senator Clinton's emotional moment in a New Hampshire cafe. Our country faces numerous critical issues, he writes, we need to know the details of each candidate's plan to deal with our problems. Instead of focusing on the issues, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED chose to discuss the impact of Mrs. Clinton's emotional response to a voter's question. Have you lowered your journalistic standards to report only sensationalist and sexist aspects of this important contest?</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Moving on to praise for yesterday's story about a young man who has chosen an unusual career path. He works as a tailor's apprentice.</p>
    <p>JOE GENUARDI: It takes a long time to learn, and the more I learn, the more I know it takes longer. And I'm okay with that, because I love what I'm doing.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Well, Nathan Gold(ph) of Ardmore, Pennsylvania loved Frank Langfitt's story. Apprenticing to one of the old trades has been a dream of mine for some time. Though tailoring is too delicate a craft for me, I was going to be a blacksmith. But just as willing apprentices have grown scarce, so too have willing masters. The young man in your story is very lucky to have tracked down such a kind and talented teacher.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: We attracted the attention of a few proud Hoosiers when we got the name of a University wrong. It is Indiana University, not the University of Indiana. I'm so sorry about that.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And finally, kind words for the words and music of Merle Haggard.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG "WHAT HAPPENED?")</p>
    <p>MERLE HAGGARD: (Singing) What happened, does anybody know? What happened, where did America go?</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Our colleague Melissa Block's conversation with Haggard drew praise from many of you, including Ally Murphy(ph) of Sarasota, Florida. And she writes, listening to Mr. Haggard made me want to pick up my cell phone and quickly call my husband. Haggard's words, thought processes and idealism made me want to share the moment. It doesn't matter if you're a punker like my husband or an '80s child like me. We can all appreciate sincerity, honesty, humility and thoughtfulness. My personal thanks to Mr. Haggard for expressing so eloquently, yet so simply the ideas of so many of us.</p>

    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG "WHAT HAPPENED?")</p>
    <p>HAGGARD: (Singing) What happened, does anybody know? What happened, where did American go? Everything Wal-Mart all the time, no more mom and pop five and dimes. What happened, where did America go?</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.</p>
