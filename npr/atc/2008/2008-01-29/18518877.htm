<h1> "President Truman's Lone Child, Margaret, Dies at 83" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>Sixty years ago, an only child living in the White House had to endure this...</p>
    <p>M: Unidentified Woman: How do you like the Secret Service men following you around on tour?</p>
    <p>MARGARET TRUMAN DANIEL: Unidentified Woman: Do you want to take a bet on that?</p>
    <p>TRUMAN DANIEL: Oh, I'm positive they don't. I've put my foot down on that in the beginning.</p>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>Margaret Truman Daniel, the daughter of President Harry Truman, died today in Chicago. She was 83 years old. In 1950, she embarked on a singing career and was panned by a Washington Post critic. Her father famously pans back, sending the critic this handwritten threat.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Someday, I hope to meet you. And when that happens, you'll need a new nose.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Margaret Truman survived both her first daughter status and her failed music career. In later life, her name appeared on a string of successful mystery novel.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And to our knowledge, "Give Him Hell Harry" never again corresponded with his daughter's critics. Margaret Truman Daniel died after a short illness. Again, she was 83 years old.</p>
