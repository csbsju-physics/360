    <p>NPR's Howard Berkes introduces us to the next likely Mormon president.</p>
    <p>HOWARD BERKES: Unidentified Group: (Singing) Sing of his goodness and mercy. We'll praise him by day and by night.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE SINGING)</p>
    <p>BERKES: Bundled up against the cold, mourners praise the man they believe was a prophet of God. Twenty-year-old Shantry Steele(ph) had mixed emotions.</p>
    <p>SHANTRY STEELE: You know, I'm cheering up, but I'm sad. But at the same time, he lived such an amazing life, and he touched so many people. I mean, even with the Olympics, we had so many people here that wanted to (unintelligible) faith and that were being exposed to the faith for the very first time. And I can't think of a better person to educate people and to show people what they LDS Church is all about than President Hinckley.</p>
    <p>BERKES: Pamela Atkinson is a non-Mormon advocate for the homeless who has worked with Monson for two decades.</p>
    <p>PAMELA ATKINSON: President Monson will build on the legacy left by President Hinckley in reaching out to everybody. He includes everybody, and he's very much at ease with anybody of any faith.</p>
    <p>BERKES: Monson described the impact of this approach in a rare news conference three years ago.</p>
    <p>THOMAS MONSON: It's just when you work together and you serve together, you understand each other and all of the animosity that people think exists evaporates. And once you've worked together, I believe each one will defend the other and correct any misconception.</p>
    <p>BERKES: Atkinson and others say humor is another attribute Monson shares with his predecessor. Here he is at a gathering of Mormon women last fall.</p>
    <p>MONSON: I'm reminded of a man who walked into a bookstore and asked the clerk, a woman, for help. Have you got the book titled "Man, the Master of Woman"? The clerk looked at him straight in the eye and said sarcastically, try the fiction section.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>BERKES: He got a good laugh, but Monson did not have hopeful words for women looking for a greater role in their patriarchal faith or lives. He urged Mormon women to seek an education because...</p>
    <p>MONSON: Statistics reveal that at some time, because of the illness or death of a husband or because of economic necessity, you may find yourself in the role of financial provider.</p>
    <p>BERKES: Jan Shipps is a non-Mormon historian who has studied Mormons for 40 years.</p>
    <p>JAN SHIPPS: President Hinckley is a hard act to follow because he was so beloved, and he was so effective as a spokesman for the church, and he was so able to control the message that the church wanted to put forth to the world.</p>
