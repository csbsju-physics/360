    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>For educators, the snow and subzero temperatures force a tough decision on closing schools. This winter, the NPR Ed team has noticed a trend. School administrators trying to soften the blow by announcing - even celebrating - snow days with some catchy videos. NPR's Elissa Nadworny reports.</p>
    <p>ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: In Swartz Creek, Mich., a suburb of Flint, school was canceled this week. Here's how students and parents found out.</p>

    <p>BEN MAINKA: (Singing) I heard about a winter storm. It's cold and dreary. Stay home. Stay warm. It's cold and it's a snowy winter morning.</p>
    <p>NADWORNY: In a video on YouTube, Superintendent Ben Mainka and High School Principal Jim Kitchen put on cool sunglasses.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, "SCCS ANNOUNCEMENT 1-29-19")</p>
    <p>JIM KITCHEN AND BEN MAINKA: (Singing) It's a snow day, a winter cold day. Stay home and just play. It's a great family day.</p>
    <p>NADWORNY: There are tons of these videos. Everyone from Rock Falls, Ill., to Missouri Valley, Iowa, to Decatur, Miss., wants in on the fun, with varying degrees of musical talent.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO MONTAGE)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #1: (Singing) And we're closed Tuesday 'til the roads are cleared by the snow plow man. And we're closed Tuesday...</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Hey, I'm staying home from school today.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED SINGER #2: (Singing) Make it grand and take it easy.</p>
    <p>BRIAN MCCANN: It's funny. It's a little mini phenomenon.</p>
    <p>NADWORNY: That's Brian McCann, the principal of Joseph Case High School in Swansea, Mass. Last winter, he starred in a snow day take on the musical "Chicago."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, "ALL THAT SNOW (SWANSEA PUBLIC SCHOOLS SCHOOL CLOSURE PSA)")</p>
    <p>MCCANN: (Singing) Hey there, kids, the super's called no school 'cause all that snow. You see, the roads...</p>
    <p>NADWORNY: There's fake snow. McCann is singing center stage with a group of students dancing around him. Teachers and students were involved in the highly secretive project.</p>
    <p>MCCANN: We had a code name for it. We called it Project Voldemort. So just like the villain in "Harry Potter," you couldn't ever mention the name.</p>
    <p>NADWORNY: They finished making the video in the fall. And then...</p>
    <p>MCCANN: We just waited and waited until we had a snow day.</p>
    <p>NADWORNY: Finally, snow arrived. They hit publish. It was such a big hit that this year, there is a sequel.</p>
    <p>MCCANN: We have one in the can, and we cannot wait for the flakes to come down in southeastern Massachusetts.</p>
    <p>NADWORNY: For now, students in Swansea are in school, so they'll just have to keep watching last year's video on YouTube.</p>
