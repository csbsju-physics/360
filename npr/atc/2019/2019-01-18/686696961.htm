<h1> "Order! Order! Listen To How The Speaker Of Britain's House Of Commons Became A Meme" </h1>
    <p>MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: </p>
    <p>Does watching news of government dysfunction ever make you want to scream at everyone, get it together?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>JOHN BERCOW: Order.</p>
    <p>KELLY: I give you John Bercow. He is speaker of the House of Commons in Britain, and he is the one charged with keeping...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>BERCOW: Order. Order.</p>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p>

    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>BERCOW: Order.</p>

    <p>KELLY: Perhaps not surprisingly, Bercow is not so popular with some of the members of Parliament we have just heard him berating, thus the news this week that the government might not elevate him to the House of Lords when he retires, which would be a major snub.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: But hey, maybe he can use his skills elsewhere, like managing kids' birthday parties.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>BERCOW: Order. Order.</p>
    <p>KELLY: How about dining decisions, like should we go out for pizza or should we just...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>BERCOW: Order.</p>
    <p>KELLY: So much meme potential and still so much Brexit debate to go.</p>
