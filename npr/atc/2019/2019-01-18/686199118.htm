<h1> "'A Different Kind Of Force': Sharon Van Etten Takes Her Sound In New Directions" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>Sharon Van Etten became famous for strumming plaintive, soulful songs on a guitar.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "EVERY TIME THE SUN COMES UP")</p>
    <p>SHARON VAN ETTEN: (Singing) Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: From the first single on her new album, it's clear that this Sharon Van Etten has a different sound.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "COMEBACK KID")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) Hey, you're the comeback kid. See me look away.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: She ditched the guitar, picked up synth and piano. And the soulful folk singer-songwriter has gone full-on rock star.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "COMEBACK KID")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) I'm the stay-out-late. I'm recovering.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Sharon Van Etten told me picking up the keyboard was like an act of translation.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: It helped me look at things in a brand new way, and I also started singing in different keys.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Wow. I imagine it's almost like trying to write a story with your left hand instead of your right hand. Like, the story's going to come out different just 'cause you're not as used to doing it.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Laughter) Well, hopefully it's not as messy.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: The new album is called "Remind Me Tomorrow," a nod to how busy Van Etten has been. In the past few years, she had her first child, took her first acting role in a TV show, went back to school for psychology, composed her first film score. And even if her music today sounds different, Sharon Van Etten says these songs still feel like her.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: My melodies are still very much what my friends would call SVE melodies because...</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Sharon Van Etten - SVE, yeah.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Laughter) But you know, I've had friends that were nervous about the change in sonics and everything. But I think even behind the production and the noises or what one of my friends references as a velociraptor somewhere in there...</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Which song were they referring to there?</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Laughter) Maybe "Hands."</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: OK.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HANDS")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) Putting my hands up...</p>
    <p>There are definitely some noises and sounds and registers that you wouldn't normally hear. But they're still love songs. And I just feel like I sing with a different kind of force, you know? Whereas my songs were brokenhearted before, these songs are more immediate, very present and much more positive.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HANDS")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) Put your hands on your lover. I've got my hands up.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: I also hear some nostalgia for the self you've left behind.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: I remember when I first moved to New York and a friend of mine took me under his wing and showed me around to certain neighborhoods he thought I would find a kinship with. And he introduced me to a community of artists and musicians. And as we were walking down a street, I remember him being upset that one of his favorite places had just closed. And then he stopped himself, and he closed his eyes. And it was like he was repeating a mantra. Throughout time, civilizations rise and fall. And then he looked at me, and he just said, it's going to change a lot here over the years, so just be ready.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SEVENTEEN")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) I know what you want to say.</p>
    <p>And then I was writing "Seventeen" at the time when I noticed myself doing that about a place that had recently closed, reflecting on all I had. I used to hang out there, and now these kids are moving into a neighborhood I can't afford anymore. And I stopped myself, and I said the same thing to myself.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SEVENTEEN")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) Downtown harks back halfway up this street. I used to be free. I used to be 17.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: So if in that song, you say, I used to be free, then what are you now?</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: When I first moved to New York, I didn't even know what it was I wanted to do. But now that I've lived in New York long enough and I'm doing all the things that I didn't realize I wanted to be doing at the time, I have different goals. And so I'm free to make those decisions, but there's a lot more of life pulling me in different directions now.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SEVENTEEN")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) I see you so uncomfortably alone. I wish I could show you how much you've grown.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: I also hear a lot of songs on this album that sound like you're trying to maybe give advice to an earlier version of yourself.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: Wouldn't you like to go back in time and hug yourself when you were a teenager and just tell them like, everything's going to be fine?</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Yeah.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: And, you know, now that I have a kid and I think about all the phases in his life - I mean, when I was pregnant, when I had him, you know, it's all this buildup around having the baby. But then you have the baby, and then you realize all the other stages in life that he's - he's going to get made fun of. He's going to not make the team. He's going to get a bad grade. He's going to think a teacher doesn't like him. He's going to get broken up with. I mean, I'm aching for him already, and he's not even two.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Is the last track on this album "Stay" about your son?</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: That song actually started as a love song to my partner before I was pregnant. And the process of writing some of these songs has been interesting because I wrote a lot of them before I was pregnant, and then I finished writing a lot of these songs after my son was born, with headphones on while he was napping, staring at him...</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Wow.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: ...Hovering. And these songs that started off as love songs to my partner ended up being love songs to something that was much more intense.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "STAY")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) You won't let me go astray. You will let me find my way.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: When I look at the things you've done in the last couple years - besides creating this album and creating a human being, composing your first film score, taking on your first acting role in the Netflix program "The OA" - I don't know how you do two of these things, let alone all of them.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: Well, you know, not to sound sexist, but I think women are better at multitasking.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: (Laughter).</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: But at the same time, I feel like there are days where I am just doing everything at a B, you know. I have an amazing partner that helps me figure out how to do it, and Google Calendar is our best friend.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: It's probably the - hopefully the nerdy thing I'll say on air, but it's very true.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Well, Sharon Van Etten, congratulations on the new album. Thanks for talking with us about it.</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: Thank you so much, Ari. I really appreciate it.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: It's called "Remind Me Tomorrow."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "COMEBACK KID")</p>
    <p>VAN ETTEN: (Singing) Hey, you're the comeback kid. See me look away.</p>
