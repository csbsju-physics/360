<h1> "Government Workers Voice Their Frustrations As They Struggle During Shutdown" </h1>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>In December, President Trump said he would shut down the government if Democrats did not agree to fund his border wall.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am proud to shut down the government for border security.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: And 11 days into that shutdown, government workers are anxious and fed up. Wendy Cyprus, whose husband has worked for the Justice Department for more than 20 years, has a message for the president.</p>
    <p>WENDY CYPRUS: That is just petty. Like, who turns their back on the people that work for the government?</p>
    <p>CORNISH: And many of those people working for the government have felt shamed for not having a bigger financial cushion.</p>
    <p>ERIN ROBERTS: People were saying shameful things about we should have a certain amount saved.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: That's Erin Roberts in California. Her wife is a recruiter for the Coast Guard, which is not protected from pay freezes during a shutdown. Robert says they got a one-time emergency payment this week, but...</p>
    <p>ROBERTS: There's still the threat of not getting paid on the 15.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: And the stress stretches from coast to coast.</p>
    <p>SARAH WATTERSON: I think a lot of people think, oh, the federal government shut down, that's just Washington - and it's really not.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Sarah Watterson (ph) is the local president for the American Federation of Government Employees in Lenexa, Kan. She says there are restrictions for federal workers looking for extra income.</p>
    <p>WATTERSON: You can't do certain jobs if it's connected to what you do for the federal government. It's a violation of ethics.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: That's really hard for workers in certain departments like science or medicine.</p>
    <p>WATTERSON: It's a very distinct skill set, and it's kind of a small world.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Chris Wall works for the Environmental Protection Agency in Honolulu. He says he's sick of federal workers being used as a political bargaining tool.</p>
    <p>CHRIS WALL: It just feels like a kick in the face every time, like we don't matter or something.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Last week, the Office of Personnel Management circulated a letter with tips for federal workers who couldn't pay rent or bills. Tyler Dayne, a government program analyst here in Washington, found it unhelpful.</p>
    <p>TYLER DAYNE: It was kind of shocking to see, like, you should offer to trade services to your landlord when it's like, I have a job to pay my rent, and it's working for the federal government.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Dayne says she doesn't have a lot of financial options.</p>
    <p>DAYNE: I would have to use credit cards probably or, like, ask family members.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Watterson says there's a feeling of being abandoned in the federal workforce right now.</p>
    <p>WATTERSON: To have to go and beg for mercy is kind of insulting.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Congress gets back to work on January 3. Without any kind of deal before then, it will be Day 13 of the government shutdown.</p>
