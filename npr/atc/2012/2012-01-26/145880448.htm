<h1> "Home Births Grow More Popular In U.S." </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>And I'm Robert Siegel. More women in the U.S. are giving birth at home. That's according to a new government study out today. Home births are still relatively rare, but they jumped 29 percent between 2004 and 2009.</p>
    <p>As NPR's Rob Stein reports, the trend is being cheered by some women's health advocates, but raising concern among doctors.</p>
    <p>ROB STEIN, BYLINE: When Kate Miller was getting ready to deliver her daughter last spring, she had no doubts that she wants to do it in her own apartment in Washington, D.C.</p>
    <p>KATE MILLER: I wanted the comfort and quiet of my own home and I didn't want any unnecessary procedures done to me or to her.</p>
    <p>STEIN: Miller is not alone. About 30,000 babies are born at home each year, about one percent of all births, and the percentage appears to be increasing faster than anyone realized.</p>
    <p>Here's T.J. Mathews of the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
    <p>T.J. MATHEWS: This is a larger change in a shorter time period, so it is something to notice.</p>
    <p>STEIN: Now, the increase isn't happening among all women. It's really happening mostly among a very specific group - white women ages 35 and older. Home births jumped 36 percent among these women. Why? Eugene Declercq of Boston University says many of these women really want to avoid getting a cesarean and other medical treatments they may not need.</p>
    <p>EUGENE DECLERCQ: It may be that older mothers who have had the experience of having had a hospital birth now want to experience a home birth because of whatever they experienced in that first birth.</p>
    <p>STEIN: And...</p>
    <p>DECLERCQ: It may be they're more comfortable challenging the system.</p>
    <p>STEIN: Whatever the reason, the trend is being welcomed by those who think home births are a better choice for many women. Katherine Prown is an advocate for midwives.</p>
    <p>KATHERINE PROWN: It's as safe for women who are at low risk as a hospital birth for low risk women, but with significantly reduced rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, unnecessary cesarean sections and also very high rates of maternal satisfaction.</p>
    <p>STEIN: But there's a lot of debate about the safety of home births. For many women with uncomplicated pregnancies, it can often be a fine alternative, but when complications occur, the results can be devastating.</p>
    <p>Amy Tuteur is an obstetrician/gynecologist and a vocal critic of home births.</p>
    <p>AMY TUTEUR: If nothing goes wrong, everything will be fine, but if something bad happens, if that happens at home, you're taking a risk.</p>
    <p>STEIN: There are really two big concerns. Making sure whoever is helping deliver the baby is qualified to spot a problem quickly and getting to the hospital in time when a life threatening complication does occur.</p>
    <p>Here's George Macones of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>
    <p>GEORGE MACONES: Sometimes, there are emergencies that you need to respond to in, you know, just a couple of minutes to ensure that the baby is doing OK and those are the ones that we really worry about.</p>
    <p>STEIN: Miller, the Washington yoga instructor, had a long, tough labor, but her daughter Ruby was born safely.</p>
    <p>MILLER: Oh, my goodness, I am so grateful, I can't tell you. I was able to have my daughter at home. I was able to have a peaceful and supported natural child birth experience. She was born in our nice, cozy bedroom. I know, you're so vocal.</p>
