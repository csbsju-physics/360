<h1> "Top Athlete In New Olympic Sport Injured" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>One of the top athletes in the new Olympic sport of ski halfpipe is in critical condition in a Utah hospital. Twenty-nine-year-old Canadian Sarah Burke was injured when she fell during a training run in Park City earlier this week.</p>
    <p>Burke is considered a pioneer in a sport where competitors on skis do the same tricks and flips that snowboarders do, all in a super-sized halfpipe. NPR's Tom Goldman reports.</p>
    <p>TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: In a sport where the potential is always there for spectacular crashes, Sarah Burke's fall reportedly was rather innocuous. She landed after performing a trick. According to one witness, she whiplashed onto her side. The fall tore an artery, which caused bleeding in her brain.</p>
    <p>A hospital release yesterday said: We need to observe the course of her brain function before making definitive pronouncements about Sarah's prognosis for recovery.</p>
    <p>Burke was injured in the same halfpipe where U.S. snowboarder Kevin Pearce suffered a brain injury in 2009. Those in the sport say the Park City halfpipe is one of the best. And the 22-foot walls - they used to be 18 - don't necessarily make it more dangerous.</p>
    <p>This is U.S. ski halfpipe coach Mike Jankowski.</p>
    <p>MIKE JANKOWSKI: It actually becomes safer, in many ways, because you have a broader area to land in.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: American Jen Hudak is one of Burke's top rivals. Hudak says a big part of her sport is managing fear. And it's going to be harder in the aftermath of Burke's accident.</p>
    <p>JEN HUDAK: I would imagine that that sits on everyone's mind. And I think especially for the girls in the sport right now, I think it's something that a lot of them are going to be considering when they're on the hill.</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Hudak considers Burke a friend, and an inspiration. Burke not only was one of those who lobbied hard to get ski halfpipe into the Olympics - it'll start in 2014 - but she fought for the inclusion of women in the sport as well. Burke talked about it in the Ski Channel feature film, "Winter."</p>

    <p>SARAH BURKE: It was a lot of sad calls to my parents, not understanding why I could beat half those boys but they wouldn't let me in the contest. I remember sending emails to X Games, you guys got girls yet?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>GOLDMAN: Her pushing paid off. Girls got into the X Games, where Burke has won four gold medals. Burke has been considered a contender for the first Olympic gold medal in her sport.</p>
