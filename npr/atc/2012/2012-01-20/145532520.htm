<h1> "Colbert, Cain Hold Rally In S.C." </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>And on the eve of tomorrow's primary, the college of Charleston was the scene of a big political rally today. And the draw was not one of the candidates we've been hearing about. It was Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert.</p>
    <p>NPR's Don Gonyea was there.</p>
    <p>DON GONYEA, BYLINE: The crowd topped 3,000, nearly all students, in the outdoor square. And right on time, 1 PM, a marching band entered clearing a path for Stephen Colbert. On stage, a gospel choir, Colbert sang harmony.</p>

    <p>STEPHEN COLBERT: (Singing) ...by the dawn's early light. What so...</p>
    <p>GONYEA: Then Colbert introduced a special guest, former presidential hopeful Herman Cain.</p>
    <p>HERMAN CAIN: As I said during one of the debates, America needs to learn how to lighten up.</p>
    <p>GONYEA: For Colbert, this rally and having Cain there to add a surreal element is all a way to make a point about campaign finance laws. Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision.</p>
    <p>COLBERT: With the stroke of a gavel, these brave men leveled the playing field and then sold the naming rights to that playing field to Bank of America.</p>
    <p>GONYEA: Last year, on this show, Colbert formed his own Super PAC. Now he's set up a presidential exploratory committee. Because of that, this month he turned control of the Super PAC over to Jon Stewart, Colbert's fellow Comedy Central star.</p>
    <p>COLBERT: If that is a joke, then they are saying our entire campaign finance system is a joke. And I don't...</p>
    <p>GONYEA: The college crowd loved it in this strange campaign year, where this fake rally was bigger than any I've covered for a real candidate.</p>
