<h1> "Young Love In Ithaca, With Schumann's Help" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>And now a Winter Song story from a listener who responded to our request for memories of music that evokes winter. This memory goes back to the winter of 1958.</p>
    <p>ALICE SWERSEY: I'm Alice Swersey and the winter piece of music is Schumann's "Piano Concerto in A."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, SCHUMANN'S "PIANO CONCERTO IN A")</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: I was a freshman at Ithaca College Conservatory of Music in Ithaca, New York and I was dating a guy from up the hill from Cornell, and on my birthday, December 2nd, I received at my dorm a dozen sweetheart roses and an album of Rudolf Serkin and the Philadelphia Orchestra playing Schumann's Piano Concerto.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, SCHUMANN'S "PIANO CONCERTO IN A")</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: Which I was totally in love with and I think I casually mentioned that to my date a few weeks before.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: And your date was your now husband?</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: My date was my now husband, Bert Swersey, and at the time that he sent it to me, he was sick and he was in the Cornell infirmary with mono.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Oh, my goodness. But he still managed to send you a birthday present?</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: He certainly did.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, SCHUMANN'S "PIANO CONCERTO IN A")</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Bert, you had remembered that Alice had mentioned in particular this piano concerto in A?</p>
    <p>BERT SWERSEY: I sure did. I think I remembered everything about Alice at that time. I was just smitten with her, so whatever she told me I think I remembered very well.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, SCHUMANN'S "PIANO CONCERTO IN A")</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Alice, what is it about this particular piano concerto that is so important to you?</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: Well, you know, a piano concerto is a conversation between a soloist and the orchestra and this is just the most romantic piece. I mean, there's something about Schumann, the emotion that he conveys.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: This is dramatic, romantic music here.</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: Yeah. Very lush and with swelling passages and then the most delicate little piano responses to the orchestra and it's really very, very beautiful.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, SCHUMANN'S "PIANO CONCERTO IN A")</p>
    <p>BLOCK: So you got the roses and the recording. There was a card, too, I think. Right?</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: The card said: Golly, you're nice. Bert.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Golly, I love that.</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: Well, I did, too.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Bert, do you remember writing that card?</p>
    <p>B. SWERSEY: I do. Yeah. We actually had been going out just since the end of October and I just - the minute I saw Alice for the first time, I just was smitten and actually before that because my friend, Bernie Kriegsman(ph) at Cornell, told me that he has a girl for me, and if I meet her I'll probably marry her. And I said, OK.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: What was it about her that made you so smitten?</p>
    <p>B. SWERSEY: Oh, when she walked down the stairs the first time I saw her, my heart really skipped a beat. She bounded down the stairs with her ponytail swinging and with her little skirt and little sweater and so on and I just - wow - took a deep breath.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: And the Schumann was sort of just the icing on the cake, I guess.</p>
    <p>A. SWERSEY: It certainly was and it is. It still is. It's still such a beautiful work.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Bert, what do you think? Was that the magic?</p>
    <p>B. SWERSEY: I think that was the magic. Absolutely. I had it all planned out. Well, I had to find some magic to capture this incredible young woman, so I guess it worked.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, SCHUMANN'S "PIANO CONCERTO IN A")</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Alice and Bert Swersey of Stephentown, New York. They've been married for 52 years.</p>
