<h1> "A Unique Expression Of Love For Math" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>Last week in Boston, 7,000 mathematicians, math teachers and math enthusiasts from all over the world converged for something called the Joint Mathematics Meeting. Naturally, there was a lot of this...</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: C plus S minus two.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Well, S is A plus B and C is two.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: Right.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: But reporter Ari Daniel Shapiro also found a lot that he wasn't expecting.</p>
    <p>ARI DANIEL SHAPIRO, BYLINE: This meeting's like a big family reunion. It just happens to be packed with people who adore math. Sarah-Marie Belcastro is a mathematician based in western Massachusetts. She also crochets and knits. Belcastro pulls out one of her current projects.</p>
    <p>SARAH-MARIE BELCASTRO: Okay. This is crochet and this is mathematical. The origin of this is, I wonder what it would look like if I made a hyperbolic mobius band.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Belcastro's crocheted mobius band is stunning. She could wear it like a wide bracelet. The edges are ruffled and they're a warm purple. For Belcastro, it's a way of visualizing a mathematical object.</p>
    <p>BELCASTRO: I want to see what I'm thinking about better. For a lot of the knitted projects, I can make things that I can look at that I couldn't see otherwise or at least not see as well.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Belcastro stands up and, within minutes, she bumps into a colleague and friend of hers.</p>
    <p>BELCASTRO: Some origami paper with you?</p>
    <p>TOM HULL: Of course I do. You want me to fold something?</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Tom Hull is a math professor at Western New England University. He studies the math of origami and how to use origami to teach math.</p>
    <p>HULL: I'm making something called a square twist. It takes that inner diamond in the center of the paper and literally twists it 90 degrees.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.</p>
    <p>HULL: I kind of think that you can't do origami without doing math. Whenever you fold a point to a line, you're actually doing calculus. Math is hidden in origami. You just don't see it, but your hands are doing it.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: I stop in on a mini course on backgammon. A large magnetic playing board stands at the front of the room.</p>
    <p>ARTHUR BENJAMIN: Black is trying to build a blockade.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: After revealing the rules, the instructors launch into a game against the computer. Before long, Arthur Benjamin, a math professor at Harvey Mudd College, dashes to an easel.</p>
    <p>BENJAMIN: So the average role in backgammon is seven plus seven over six.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: The 30 audience members include teachers and professors who might bring something like this to their students. They're rapt, hooked on watching the unfolding game. Eventually, it's over.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: And the mathematicians have won.</p>
    <p>BENJAMIN: Math definitely makes me a better backgammon player. If you can figure out probabilities, it's essentially like rolling the game out infinitely many times. It gives you a great deal of information.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: In between giving and listening to formal math talks, a good sized crowd has gathered for the mini course on math and dance.</p>
    <p>KARL SCHAFFER: One arm up. I don't care if you mirror me or otherwise.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Karl Schaffer is leading the class in a full body warm-up on a dance floor that the meeting organizers have provided. Schaffer is a mathematician at De Anza College and co-directs a small contemporary dance troop in California.</p>
    <p>SCHAFFER: I would like the participants to experience creating movement phrases and performing them for each other in ways that deal with mathematical concepts.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Concepts like shape, symmetry and number sequences. Everywhere I turned at this meeting, I saw mathematicians celebrating the connections between math and the other elements of their lives.</p>
    <p>Colin Adams is a mathematician at Williams College who writes and performs plays about math and he says these kinds of efforts help translate a love and passion for math into friendlier arenas.</p>
    <p>COLIN ADAMS: You know, I mean, sometimes people get turned off easily because they just get bored and the goal has always been to keep their interest long enough to see the beauty of the mathematics.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: It's about trying on a kind of aesthetic, one in which math spins and weaves and sings and where it wins the game every single time. For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel Shapiro.</p>
