<h1> "Bhi Bhiman: Penetrating Melodies, Striking Vocals" </h1>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>BHI BHIMAN: (Singing) Hold me down, keep me back. I don't know what I'd do. My baby's with that man again. I thought that they was through.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>This is the music of singer-songwriter Bhi Bhiman. With his folk melodies and wry lyrics, he's been compared to Woody Guthrie. His new album is called "Bhiman" and Robert Christgau has our review.</p>
    <p>ROBERT CHRISTGAU, BYLINE: Delivering a brief, early opening set in Manhattan one recent Monday, Bhi Bhiman looked like a law clerk in Mumbai stopping by for a drink after work - a neat South Asian man in a newsboy cap and glasses wearing a gray sweater over a wing-collared white shirt, except for one thing. He was holding a big acoustic guitar and picking it John Hurt style as he sang a little something about kimchee.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "KIMCHEE LINE")</p>
    <p>BHIMAN: (Singing) So I climbed upon a ladder to see what I could see. Well, the (unintelligible) is getting fatter, I feel my stomach bleed. I'm on the Kimchee line. I'm on the Kimchee line. I'm on the Kimchee line and it's scallion time.</p>
    <p>CHRISTGAU: Singing blues in a vocal style that suggests a more modest Nina Simone would be an unusual formal choice for any young person in 2012. For a second generation Sri Lankan-American who grew up on grunge, it's a heroic act of will, but Bhiman's songs would be remarkable from anybody. Here's another track from his self-titled album. It's called "Ballerina."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BALLERINA")</p>
    <p>BHIMAN: (Singing) We got married in a Wal-Mart down by the Wrangler jeans. I'm 'a dress my baby like a vampire next week on Halloween.</p>
    <p>CHRISTGAU: Bhiman is a penetrating melodist, as well as an accomplished guitarist and a striking singer, but what he likes best about songwriting is word play. Note the trick rhymes on the sadder, but funnier "Life's Been Better."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LIFE'S BEEN BETTER")</p>
    <p>BHIMAN: (Singing) Life's been better. I had more cheddar, but all my feta's run dry. I packed my bag and I'm headed for Saginaw. I'm guessing that you're tagging along. I called my captain to make something happen, but he said that he was napping it off.</p>
    <p>CHRISTGAU: Bhi Bhiman is a work in progress. He gets a lot out of his guitar and some spare accompaniment, but he's mired in four-four rhythmically, and his personal songs don't sink as deep as the descriptive ones. Nevertheless, he's an original in a folky mode that always looks played out until the next surprise from nowhere comes along.</p>
    <p>That surprise begins with the first track on "Bhiman," a song called the "Guttersnipe" that had me listening before his voice even entered.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GUTTERSNIPE")</p>
    <p>BHIMAN: (Singing) I jumped the first train I saw. It'll surely take me home.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: The new album from Bhi Bhiman is called "Bhiman." Our reviewer is Robert Christgau.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GUTTERSNIPE")</p>
    <p>BHIMAN: (Singing) I had a mama. At least I'd have a place to go, but I'm just a guttersnipe. I got no place to wipe my nose.</p>
