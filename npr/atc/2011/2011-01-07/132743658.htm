<h1> "What Sports Rule Would You Change?" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>We just heard about new rule changes in the NFL. But we're thinking, why stop there?</p>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>Sports fans complain all the time about rules. Here's your chance to complain to us. What rule changes do you want to see in your favorite sports?</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Fewer timeouts at the end of a basketball game, or maybe required fighting in hockey.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
