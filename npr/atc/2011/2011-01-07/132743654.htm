<h1> "New NFL Overtime Rules Kick In" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>Sportswriter Stefan Fatsis joins us now, as he does most Fridays. Hey, Stefan.</p>
    <p>STEFAN FATSIS: Hey, Michele.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Now, before we get down to this weekend's big games, we've got some football business news to take care of. Let's handle that first. There were reports this week that the NFL was close to extending its television contract with ESPN. Please tell us more.</p>
    <p>FATSIS: That's going to put the NFL in an awkward position. The league is negotiating with its players' union over a new labor contract. It is arguing that its economics are in turmoil, and it's kind of hard to make that argument if you're getting paid $2 billion a year for the rights to one game a week.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Yeah, it seems like you could just say thank you.</p>
    <p>FATSIS: You've got to read between Goodell's platitudes about protecting player safety while simultaneously giving fans more regular season games, which the league wants to do. This letter is simply part of a public relations strategy that the league is going to need if, as many people fear, a deal stalls, the NFL locks out the players and, worst-case scenario, some or all of 2011, the season gets cancelled.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Oh, horror. Let's not think of that. But we...</p>
    <p>FATSIS: And after that...</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Now, can you give us a quick breakdown, and I just got to say, the Seahawks?</p>
    <p>FATSIS: They made it because they won a very weak National Football Conference West Division. Their opponents, the Saints, won 11 games, but they're the ones that have to get on a plane and travel six hours and play a road game in a very noisy stadium.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: How does that happen?</p>
    <p>FATSIS: I think you could go further and get rid of divisions entirely, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Stefan, we need you to help us out with something. There's one longstanding practice in the NFL that's changed for the playoff season, and that's the way a tied game is settled in overtime. It's always been sudden death. First team to score wins. Not anymore. Tell us about this new procedure.</p>
    <p>FATSIS: I think that both teams should have a crack at the ball in an overtime because there's more equity in that, but I think it should happen regardless of the method of scoring.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Thank you, Stefan. Happy viewing this weekend.</p>
    <p>FATSIS: Thanks, Michele.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: That's Stefan Fatsis. He's the author of "A Few Seconds of Panic: A Sportswriter Plays in the NFL," and he joins us most Fridays to talk about sports and the business of sports.</p>
