<h1> "Journalist On Challenges Facing Female Sports Reporters" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>Veteran sports reporter Andrea Kremer joins me to talk about the climate for women journalists in sports. She's a sideline reporter with NBC's "Sunday Night Football," and she started her TV career at ESPN back in 1989 as the network's first female correspondent. Andrea, welcome to the program.</p>
    <p>ANDREA KREMER: Thanks, Melissa, great to chat with you.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Does this incident to you seem to be a reflection on a bigger issue of how women sports reporters are treated?</p>
    <p>KREMER: You know, women have earned their positions. I've always maintained there's not a sports gene that only men possess, and it doesn't always have to be about why they are there. It should be, in my opinion, about what do they contribute to a telecast or to a broadcast.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Have you heard this over the years, Andrea, that you can't possibly know the game as a woman if you haven't played it?</p>
    <p>KREMER: They were buying me books. They were supporting my interest. And believe me, Melissa, I hear this all the time. Oh, did you have brothers? Is that why you like sports? No, I like sports because I just have loved it my whole life. But no, it's not something that's just endemic to men. Women can love it and be knowledgeable about it, just as men can.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Do you think there's a particular hurdle for women who are sideline reporters, that they have to justify their presence in a way that male sideline reporters would not be questioned?</p>
    <p>KREMER: But you're there to - for your observational skills and to report, and there is reporting that can be done. See, I think that's the key, Melissa, is I think with the role of sideline reporter, the word reporter gets lost.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: I think we've all heard, though, inane questions from sideline reporters, both men and women. And I wonder, when you hear those questions coming specifically from a woman reporter, do you kind of wince and say, boy, that's just going to reflect badly on all of us, make my job even harder?</p>
    <p>KREMER: And look, your 10th-degree fallback should always be: What adjustments do you need to make, coach? It's not a compelling question, but if you give something specific, you know, for the most part you're going to get something usable that you want to say on air.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: What do you think it would take to have more women in the booth or in the studio? There are some now, but mostly women are on the sidelines.</p>
    <p>KREMER: You need to work from the ground up. You need to pay your dues, and you need to earn those stripes. I mean, I would not be in favor of just throwing a woman in the booth if she had never done it before. And I think that that's something that's really important to keep in mind.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Andrea Kremer is sideline reporter with NBC's "Sunday Night Football." Andrea, thanks very much.</p>
    <p>KREMER: It's a pleasure, Melissa. Thank you so much.</p>
