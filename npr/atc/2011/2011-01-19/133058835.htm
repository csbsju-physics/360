    <p>NPR's Nina Totenberg reports.</p>
    <p>NINA TOTENBERG: Robert Nelson is a senior research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Lab.</p>
    <p>ROBERT NELSON: They can ask about who I slept with, who I smoked dope with when I was in college, if I did smoke dope, et cetera. They can ask everything about my entire personal life.</p>
    <p>TOTENBERG: And pointing to WikiLeaks, he contends that federal rules barring disclosure of the information are no solace.</p>
    <p>NELSON: They can't keep it private. It's just not the way it happens in the information age.</p>
