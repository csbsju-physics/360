<h1> "Three Books For Your Motorcycle Road Trip" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>For many Americans, a motorcycle trip on the open road is a delicious fantasy. For writer Jonathan Bastian, it became a reality. But no road trip on two wheels is complete without a little relevant reading material. So he has these recommendations, as part of our series Three Books where writers recommend three books on one theme.</p>
    <p>JONATHAN BASTIAN: So for those of you who've always dreamed of taking a similar adventure, you've got no more excuses, because I've already solved the hardest problem of taking this trip or, for that matter, any trip. It isn't figuring out where you'll go or how you'll get the bike but deciding on what books you'll bring.</p>

    <p>BLOCK: Jonathan Bastian is a literary contributor at Aspen Public Radio. You can catch up on more Three Books recommendations at our website, npr.org.</p>
