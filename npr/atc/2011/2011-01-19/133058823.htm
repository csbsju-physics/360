    <p>When he came to NPR, the newborn network was just about to launch its first program, this one.</p>
    <p>CLEVE MATHEWS: In addition to our own staff of reporters and editors here in Washington, we will be drawing on specialists and interesting, articulate people across the country to report for us.</p>

    <p>SIEGEL: My colleague Susan Stamberg says this about Cleve Mathews: He brought depth and focus to a small, new, ragamuffin team of reporters and producers. He had the highest standards and did much to shape and further the early, now permanent, values of National Public Radio.</p>
