<h1> "13 New Senators Sworn In, As Senate Gets To Work" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, host: </p>
    <p>On the other side of the Capitol today, Democrats began their fifth year in a row in control of the United States Senate. One year ago, they had a filibuster-proof majority, but their ranks have shrunk. And some Democrats used their first day in session to demand changes in rules governing the filibuster. NPR's David Welna is at the Capitol and he has this report. </p>
    <p>DAVID WELNA: Only a third of the Senate seats are up for election every two years. So today, those Senators who got reelected along with 13 newly elected members were sworn in by the president of the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden. </p>
    <p>Vice President JOE BIDEN: Would you please raise your right hands. I'm going to read the entire oath and you will respond appropriately. </p>
    <p>WELNA: And all did as they were told. The Senate now has 47 Republicans, 51 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. It also has in its ranks Maryland Democrat Barbara Mikulski, who today became the first woman ever sworn into a fifth term in the Senate. </p>
    <p>Senator BARBARA MIKULSKI (Democrat, Maryland): When I walked down that aisle, I walked into the history books. I never set out to do that. And for me, it's a great honor to join Margaret Chase Smith in the history books. </p>
    <p>WELNA: But once the opening day niceties were over, majority leader Harry Reid brought up what for many senators is an unpleasant subject: the desire of some Democrats to change the rules on when filibusters can be used to block legislation or nominations. </p>
    <p>Senator HARRY REID: (Democrat, Nevada; Majority Leader): No one can deny that the filibuster has been used for purely political reasons, reasons far beyond those for which this protection was invented and intended. So Mr. President, I say, through the chair, to my distinguished Republican counterpart, my friend, Senator McConnell, in the coming days, let's come together to find a solution. </p>
    <p>WELNA: Senator McConnell, of course, is the Republican leader. The people, he said, want to be heard. And only the minority's use of the filibuster can ensure that happens. </p>
    <p>Senator MITCH McCONNELL (Republican, Kentucky; Minority Leader): And the response they are now getting from some on the other side instead is a proposal to change the Senate rules so they can continue to do exactly what they want with fewer members than before. Instead of changing their behavior in response to the last election, they want to change the rules. </p>
    <p>WELNA: But McConnell also made clear he's willing to work with Reid. </p>
    <p>Sen. McCONNELL: At a time when some people think that two parties in Washington can't even agree on the weather, I'll note that Senator Reid and I get along just fine. </p>
    <p>WELNA: Whether the Senate gets along with the Republican-controlled House, maybe another story. </p>
