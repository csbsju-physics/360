<h1> "Three Minute Fiction Deadline Draws Near" </h1>
    <p>GUY RAZ, host: </p>
    <p>The writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the bestselling author of "Purple Hibiscus" and "Half of a Yellow Sun," and she's also judging our current round of Three-Minute Fiction here on Weekends on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of clock ticking) </p>
    <p>RAZ: And we're here to remind you that today is the last day to get your stories in this round. We're asking for original short fiction that can be read in under three minutes, so no more than 600 words. But Chimamanda, what's the catch? </p>
    <p>CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE: Well, Guy, this round, we're all about emotions. So at some point in the story, one of the characters must tell a joke. Also, one of the characters must cry. </p>
    <p>RAZ: And to clarify, the joke and crying can be done by the same character or by different characters, as long as both happen in the story. And, as usual, we have to stick to the deadline. </p>
    <p>ADICHIE: So you have to get your stories in by 11:59 Eastern Time. </p>
    <p>RAZ: That's 11:59 p.m. tonight. Remember, Eastern Time. To read the full rules and to submit your story, go to our website, npr.org/threeminutefiction. That's threeminutefiction all spelled out, no spaces. </p>
