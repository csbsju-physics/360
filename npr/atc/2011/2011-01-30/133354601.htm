<h1> "Tunisian Poet's Verses Inspire Arab Protesters" </h1>
    <p>GUY RAZ, host: </p>
    <p>Our top story this hour, of course, the ongoing demonstrations in Egypt. Thousands of protesters are still gathered in cities across that country despite a government curfew. Demonstrators are vowing to keep up the pressure until President Hosni Mubarak steps down. </p>
    <p>And among the chants and slogans in those crowds are the words of an early 20th century Tunisian poet named Abdul Qasim al Shabi. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>RAZ: One of his most famous poems has become a rallying cry, both in Egypt and before, in Tunisia. The poem is called "To the Tyrants of the World" </p>
    <p>(Foreign language spoken) </p>
    <p>Oppressive tyrants, lover of darkness, enemy of life, you have ridiculed the size of the weak people. Your palm is soaked with their blood. </p>
    <p>You deformed the magic of existence, and planted the seeds of sorrow in the fields. </p>
    <p>(Foreign language spoken) </p>
    <p>Wait, don't be fooled by the spring, the clearness of the sky or the light of dawn, for on the horizon lies the horror of darkness, rumble of thunder, and blowing of winds. </p>
    <p>Beware, for below the ash there is fire, and he who grows thorns reaps wounds. Look there, for I have harvested the heads of mankind and the flowers of hope, and I watered the heart of the earth with blood. I soaked it with tears until it was drunk. The river of blood will sweep you, and the fiery storm will devour you. </p>
    <p>(Foreign language spoken) </p>
