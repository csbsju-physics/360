<h1> "Rural Tunisians Hope Revolt Brings Jobs, Opportunity" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>NPR's Eric Westervelt paid a visit to the town of Sidi Bouzid, where the first protests occurred.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CONVERSATIONS)</p>
    <p>ERIC WESTERVELT: It's a sunny weekday afternoon and dozens of young men, almost all in their 20s, play cards, sip tea and smoke at a dingy no-name cafe on the outskirts of Sidi Bouzid. A faded poster of Brooke Shields hangs on the wall. Most of these men here have university degrees. They are all unemployed.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF CONVERSATIONS)</p>
    <p>WESTERVELT: Twenty-nine-year-old Taoufik Hamdouni sits with his friends, as he does most every day. His hair is trimmed and neat. His, shirt pressed and clean, as if he's dressed for a job interview that never seems to come. Hamdouni graduated from college nearly seven years ago with a civil engineering degree. He's been jobless ever since.</p>
    <p>TAOUFIK HAMDOUNI: (Foreign language spoken)</p>
    <p>WESTERVELT: Unidentified Man #1: (Singing in foreign language)</p>
    <p>WESTERVELT: Unidentified Man #2: Ah, hey.</p>
    <p>WESTERVELT: The 26-year-old even searched outside Tunisia for work. But he was asked to pay about $5,000 to a job broker - almost five months' pay for his father, a schoolteacher.</p>
    <p>MARWAN CHOKRI: (Foreign language spoken)</p>
    <p>WESTERVELT: Hamdouni has four brothers and three sisters. All have university degrees. Only one of them has a job, a brother who works as an elementary school teacher.</p>

    <p>HAMDOUNI: (Foreign language spoken)</p>
    <p>WESTERVELT: Eric Goldstein is deputy director of Human Rights Watch for North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
    <p>ERIC GOLDSEIN: It really is about jobs for them and the resentment that people in other parts of the country seem to be part of this Tunisia that everybody talks of as being a middle class country, you know, well-educated, moderate, open to the world, and they're back there struggling every day.</p>
    <p>WESTERVELT: So an urgent issue - among the many any new Tunisian government has to face - is economic development in the rural hinterlands.</p>
