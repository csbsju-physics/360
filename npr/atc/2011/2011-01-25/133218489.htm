    <p>SARHADDI NELSON: For many hours, that order didn't come. Protestors were free to march, which is rarely allowed here. They filled major streets and stopped traffic with the support of many drivers, like this cab driver.</p>

    <p>SARHADDI NELSON: First-time protestor Adel al Sharif said he decided to march because of the popular uprising in Tunisia earlier this month. The father of three says he and others here want political and economic freedom.</p>
    <p>ADEL AL SHARIF: This is the exact thing that moves everybody. The status quo is too much, too much not doing anything or not progressing my children are growing I don't know how to tell them that we've been living like this for ages. So we need this changed.</p>
