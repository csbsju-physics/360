    <p>CHERYL CORLEY: President Hu began his day with a visit to Chicago's Walter Payton High School, home to the Confucius Institute. In a partnership with public schools, the institute teaches about 12,000 students Mandarin Chinese. Alex Guiravich(ph), a sophomore, who started taking Mandarin last year, was one of the lucky ones on-hand for the president's visit.</p>
    <p>ALEX GUIRAVICH: It's weird thinking that the president of China picked our school out of all the schools in the United States to go to. But it's cool.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>CORLEY: Students from several schools waved Chinese and American flags and welcomed Hu in his native tongue. They treated him to performances, including a traditional Chinese handkerchief dance.</p>
    <p>HU JINTAU: (Foreign language spoken)</p>
    <p>CORLEY: Last night, at a formal dinner for Hu, Mayor Daley said it was a relationship that will endure.</p>
    <p>RICHARD DALEY: Our long-range goal is to make Chicago the most China-friendly city in the United States and to establish it as China's gateway to Americas.</p>
    <p>CORLEY: Speaking through an interpreter during the dinner, President Hu said there's been a substantial increase in the number of exports from Midwestern states since 2000.</p>
    <p>JINTAU: (Through translator) Boeing, Motorola, Caterpillar, McDonald's and many other well-known companies have become household names in China.</p>
    <p>CORLEY: This was the first time President Hu visited Chicago. And last night, a crowd of supporters rallied across the street from his downtown hotel. Student Ping Ting-li(ph) had traveled from downstate Illinois in hopes of getting a glimpse of Hu.</p>
    <p>PING TING: Unidentified Group: Hu Jintao is a murderer.</p>
    <p>CORLEY: Punsok Doji(ph), who had traveled from Minnesota, said talk about trade deals shouldn't dominate the conversation with China's leader in town.</p>
    <p>PUNSOK DOJI: They consider that human rights is not a big deal, but the trade deal is the biggest deal. That's actually not a fair deal. The fair deal is the human rights is the fair deal and the biggest deal.</p>
