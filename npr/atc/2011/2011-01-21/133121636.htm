<h1> "Remembering The Legacy Of Chemist Albert Ghiorso" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>Albert Ghiorso co-discovered 12 chemical elements, more than anyone in history. He died in December at the age of 95. His memorial service was last weekend in Berkeley, California.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SCHMIEDER: The reason he was legendary is because he seemed to be able to do magic things that other people couldn't do.</p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>That's fellow physicist Robert Schmieder. He knew Albert Ghiorso for 40 years.</p>
    <p>SCHMIEDER: When you would talk with Albert, you were acutely aware that he was extraordinarily focused on the subject and his mind was extremely quick.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Ghiorso never got an advanced degree, no doctorate, just a bachelor's in electrical engineering. During the Second World War, he worked on the Manhattan Project.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: It was then that Ghiorso helped discover the first of his 12 elements: americium and curium. After the war, Ghiorso returned to Berkeley, where he co- discovered two more elements and took the opportunity to pay homage to his hometown.</p>
    <p>SCHMIEDER: And those were named berkelium and californium.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Albert Ghiorso developed new instruments and new techniques to help discover new elements not found in nature. Rounding out the list are einsteinium, fermium.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Mendelevium, nobelium.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Lawrencium, rutherfordium.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Dubnium and seaborgium.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Albert Ghiorso died last month at the age of 95. That's also the atomic number of the first new element he helped discover.</p>
