    <p>NPR's Rob Gifford has that story from Shanghai.</p>
    <p>ROB GIFFORD: When Barack Obama visited China at the end of 2009, he held a town hall meeting in Shanghai that was the hottest ticket in town. Graduate student Qian Jin succeeded in getting into the event and got to shake the presidential hand.</p>
    <p>QIAN JIN: He's like a rock star. Every student wants to shake hands with him, and he's very nice. I think that is the highest moment for me and for many of my friends. They say, yeah, shaking hands with Barack Obama probably is the highest moment.</p>
    <p>GIFFORD: But Qian concedes, by and large, on the policy front, Obama hasn't made much difference to either China-U.S. relations or the U.S. economy more generally. Qian reached out for Obama's hand, but he thinks Obama was overhyped, and that Americans are generally too emotional about their leaders.</p>
    <p>JIN: In China, they're so pragmatic. They pay more attention to the real policy than a person. In China, they are saying that what people doing is much more important than what he is saying.</p>
    <p>GIFFORD: Tong Shijun of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences says that Obama as being the first black president still resonates with many Chinese.</p>
    <p>TONG SHIJUN: President Obama is a positive resource for public relations of the United States at the international level.</p>
    <p>GIFFORD: Why?</p>
    <p>SHIJUN: Because he sent a message that ordinary people can reach his or her ideals. In his words, nothing is impossible, right? Is that his motto? Rob GIFFORD: Yes We Can was the actual phrase. And who'd have thought there'd be a place in downtown Shanghai playing sections of President Obama's inaugural speech on a loop?</p>
    <p>BARACK OBAMA: And with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom.</p>
    <p>GIFFORD: At Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, young Shanghainese are lining up to take pictures of themselves with a startling likeness of the 44th President of the United States.</p>
    <p>ZHU JIETING: (Foreign language spoken)</p>
    <p>GIFFORD: I think he's great, says visiting 20-something Zhu Jieting, and we shouldn't be too impatient. Things take time, she says.</p>
