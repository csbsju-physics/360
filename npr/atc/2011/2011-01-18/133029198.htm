<h1> "How The iPhone Figures In The U.S.-China Trade Gap" </h1>

    <p>This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>But as NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports, the numbers don't tell the whole story.</p>
    <p>WENDY KAUFMAN: For help, we turn to Glenn Fleishman, a technology writer for the economist.com and other publications.</p>
    <p>GLENN FLEISHMAN: This is an iPhone 4. This is made of dozens or hundreds of components in it - some large, some small.</p>
    <p>KAUFMAN: Those components are made in the U.S., South Korea, Japan and many other places, but they are assembled into an iPhone in a factory in China.</p>
    <p>FLEISHMAN: Just on the back of the main logic board, there's a chip from Samsung. It's got the memory. There's a Cirrus Logic audio codec. There's a Texas Instruments touch-screen controller, which...</p>
    <p>KAUFMAN: Mark Doms, the chief economist at the Commerce Department, acknowledges this approach has limitations but says there really isn't any other way to do it.</p>
    <p>MARK DOMS: There's just really no practical way to ask companies to break out the value of the goods by country of origin for all the individual components. That just isn't very feasible.</p>
    <p>KAUFMAN: So the total wholesale value of the iPhone - for the 3G, it was about $180 - goes on the Chinese import side of the trade ledger. As a result, says Rob Feenstra, an economist at the University of California, Davis, the...</p>
    <p>ROB FEENSTRA: U.S. trade deficit with China tends to be exaggerated.</p>
    <p>KAUFMAN: In a much-talked-about paper, Chinese economist Yuqing Xing took a stab at the figure.</p>
    <p>YUQING XING: If you look at the manufacturing costs, China contribution is $6.50.</p>
    <p>KAUFMAN: That $6.50 is the estimated cost of the actual assembly. He says if you use that figure, not the entire wholesale amount, the U.S. trade deficit with China would be about $2 billion less.</p>
    <p>XING: Yes, yes. Actually, yeah, that's the bottom line.</p>
    <p>KAUFMAN: Some economists dispute his figures, but there's little doubt that the real trade deficit with China is less than the number that shows up in the headlines.</p>
    <p>KAUFMAN: Still, Department of Commerce economist Mark Doms says...</p>
    <p>DOMS: Even if we think about the iPhone and whatnot, the overall pattern of the increase in trade deficit with China won't be changed by these types of issues.</p>
