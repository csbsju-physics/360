<h1> "Novelist, Professor Reynolds Price Dies" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. </p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, host: </p>
    <p>And I'm Robert Siegel. </p>
    <p>Two literary obituaries now. From North Carolina comes news that Reynolds Price died today. He was a longtime Duke University English professor and he was, in every sense of the word, a writer. </p>
    <p>Mr. REYNOLDS PRICE (writer): I've written everything from novels to television commercials. I once wrote the text for a Calvin Klein commercial, a confession I only now made public. But even I have yet to write an epitaph. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: That was from a commentary Reynolds Price wrote for ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. He was a contributor from 1996 until 2002. </p>
    <p>Reynolds Price was a Southern writer. He set most of his books in his native North Carolina. And he was, in the words of Duke University President Richard Brodhead, a part of the soul of Duke. </p>
    <p>His connection with us began with a story in 1996 about a speech he made at Founder's Day in 1992, when he called the Duke campus to account for what he called the most commonly heard sentence in the dining halls. </p>
    <p>Mr. PRICE: The sentence runs more or less like this, in male or female voice - I can't believe how drunk I was last night. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: The speech launched a season of self-scrutiny at Duke. For the last 25 years of his life, Reynolds Price was paraplegic. That was the result of a malignant spinal tumor and the surgeries and radiation he underwent. He suffered a heart attack on Sunday and he died this afternoon. Reynolds Price was 77. </p>
