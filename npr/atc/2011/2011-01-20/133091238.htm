<h1> "Letters: A Clarification; Lego Stadium" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>Now to your comments about our program, and a clarification. Yesterday in our coverage of the White House press conference featuring the Chinese president, we explained that he was speaking through a translator. </p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, host: </p>
    <p>Well, that sent Judy Jenner(ph) of Las Vegas running to her computer, where she typed out this: </p>
    <p>(Reading) I must correct you on your incorrect use of the term 'translator.' Translators work with the written word, while interpreters work with the spoken word. </p>
    <p>And she adds, I am both. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: So we checked with Corinne McKay from the American Translators Association, which represents both translators and interpreters. </p>
    <p>Ms. CORINNE MCKAY (American Translators Association): So the main difference between translators and interpreters is that translators work in writing and interpreters work in speaking. I'm an NPR fanatic, and one of the only things I don't like about NPR is that your reporters consistently say 'speaking through a translator,' and you can't speak through a translator. You only speak through an interpreter. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Duly noted. Well, now to yesterday's interview with Paul Janssen. He is a professor of physiology and cell biology at the Ohio State University. I didn't talk with him about cells. We talked with him about Legos.  Professor Janssen built a replica of Ohio State's football stadium entirely of Legos. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Matt Weinberg(ph) of Irvine, California follows us on Twitter, and Robert, he tweeted this about one phrase that you used.  He says: I love Robert Siegel for referring to Lego builders as Lego users. It makes Legos sound like a new type of drug. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: (Laughing) Lego-tics. And Mindy Stubsen(ph) of San Luis Obispo, California was left with a lingering question: What did he do with the stadium after he built it in his basement? </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Well, we found the answer. Janssen plans to display his Lego stadium on campus and hopefully use it to fundraise for his research. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Keep your emails and your tweets coming. You can write to us at npr.org or join us on Twitter at npratc. </p>
