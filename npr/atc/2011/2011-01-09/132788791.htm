    <p>(Soundbite of clock ticking) </p>
    <p>GUY RAZ, host: </p>
    <p>The clock is now ticking on our Three-Minute Fiction contest here on weekends on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Round Six is now open. </p>
    <p>Ms. CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE: I want you to write a story in which one character tells a joke, and one character cries. </p>
    <p>RAZ: That's our judge this round, novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, with her new challenge. To see the full rules and submit your story, go to our website npr.org/threeminutefiction. And Three Minute Fiction is all spelled out, no spaces. And good luck. </p>
