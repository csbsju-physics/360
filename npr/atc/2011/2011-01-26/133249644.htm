    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>Along with a wave of innovation, Sputnik also spawned a boom in memorabilia, from glassware to globes, clothing to furniture. </p>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, host: </p>
    <p>There's the Sputnik blueprint tile coaster online for a mere $10, also available as a framed tile for $5 more. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: The Sputnik 20th anniversary 15 ounce mug, a bargain at $15, also available in large for 18. </p>
    <p>NORRIS: There's also a Sputnik anniversary cap and T-shirt available in both light and dark. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: A handsome Sputnik light fixture in a modern 1950s style made of polished brass. </p>
    <p>NORRIS: And no collection would be complete without a lovely 4-by-5 photo reprint of the Sputnik 2 dog, Laika, from 1958. </p>
    <p>NORRIS: We may not have beaten the Russians into space, but when it comes to the tchotchkes race, we're going strong. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song, "Sputnik, Satellite Girl") </p>
    <p>JERRY ENGLER AND THE FOUR EKKOS (Band): (Singing) Well, I say the fun has just begun. We're on Sputnik number one. A'flying through outer space at a rockin' rollin' pace. Hey, we're going to get our kicks on a little old thing called a Sputnik. I said spoo-spoo-spoot-a-nick-a-chick. I said spoo-spoo-spoot-a-nick-a-chick. I said spoo-spoo-spoot-a-nick-a-chick. I said spoo-spoo-spoot-a-nick-a-chick. Flying all around the world with my crazy satellite girl. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. </p>
