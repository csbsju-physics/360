<h1> "In A Small Corner Of YouTube, A Web Star Is Born" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, host: </p>
    <p>Asian-Americans have never been a big enough or cohesive enough fragment of the culture to support a whole TV network like BET or Univision. But now, online video is a vibrant alternative to television. </p>
    <p>And that means a fan base of mostly Asian teens is enough to support a new kind of star. Corey Takahashi reports. </p>
    <p>COREY TAKAHASHI: At the moment, there's one YouTube celebrity with more subscribers than anyone else, not Lady Gaga, not Justin Bieber, either. </p>
    <p>Mr. RYAN HIGA: First things first, I'm not your average teenager... </p>
    <p>TAKAHASHI: More than three million fans on YouTube have signed up to receive updates and videos from a college student who was raised in Hilo, Hawaii. His name is Ryan Higa. </p>
    <p>Mr. HIGA: As long as I can remember, I've been training to become an ASS, an agent of secret stuff. </p>
    <p>TAKAHASHI: Higa's latest 35-minute movie is called "Agents of Secret Stuff." It's an action-comedy set in high school. It features a who's who of YouTube celebrities. The video's clocked well over eight million views in the past two months. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of video) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: You must operate cautiously. </p>
    <p>Mr. HIGA: I will not fail. </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man #1: Cool, peace out. </p>
    <p>TAKAHASHI: A Pasadena-based production house, Wong Fu Productions, directed, co-wrote and co-produced the project with Higa. Philip Wang is a co-founder, and he also acts in the movie. </p>
    <p>Mr. PHILIP WANG (Co-Founder, Wong Fu Productions): People, especially through YouTube, they're finding types of entertainment that are just from people that are just like themselves or people that they can relate to a little bit better than, you know, some unattainable movie star or TV star. </p>
    <p>And so when they see people like Ryan, or they see people like us, you know, it's someone that they feel a more personal connection to. </p>
    <p>TAKAHASHI: Stars like Ryan Higa can earn up to six-figure incomes a year, based on ads YouTube pairs with their videos. </p>
    <p>Mr. GEORGE STROMPOLOS: It's not all a Hollywood ecosystem anymore. </p>
    <p>TAKAHASHI: George Strompolos used to cultivate online video talent in his former job at YouTube. Now he's working with many of the same stars as a producer in Los Angeles. </p>
    <p>Mr. STROMPOLOS: For whatever reason, the studio system is not creating, in this case, Asian-American celebrities. So fans of Ryan have actually elevated him to that level through their own means. In this case, that's through YouTube and through the Internet. </p>
    <p>TAKAHASHI: But even Philip Wang of Wong Fu Productions will admit one downside to this newer pathway to stardom. </p>
    <p>Mr. WANG: We have lost a little bit of the classy kind of stars, you know, from, you know, the Frank Sinatra or Gene Kelly age. </p>
    <p>TAKAHASHI: As Ol' Blue Eyes might say, in the YouTube age, it's even more about doing it my way. </p>
    <p>For NPR News, I'm Corey Takahashi. </p>
