<h1> "Tunisians Wary About Future As Violence Continues" </h1>
    <p>GUY RAZ, Host: </p>
    <p>Eleanor Beardsley has a story from the Tunisian capital of Tunis.</p>
    <p>ELEANOR BEARDSLEY: Some were afraid to talk about it, but not 22-year-old Hishem Benyaghem.</p>
    <p>HISHEM BENYAGHEM: (French spoken)</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: I'm very optimistic, he said. This is going to be great for Tunisia. Just fantastic.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTERS)</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: Claire Spencer, an expert on the Middle East, says that one incident galvanized the population's growing anger.</p>
    <p>CLAIRE SPENCER: When the corruption is too flagrant and the responses are too heavy handed, people suddenly say, this is beyond what I and my personal dignity can withstand.</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: Moncef Marzouki is the head of a banned opposition party. He's been living in France for the last decade, but he's coming home to run for office.</p>
    <p>MONCEF MARZOUKI: (Through translator) I am so proud the Tunisian people were able to defeat a dictator. We cannot let anyone steal this revolution from the Tunisian people.</p>
    <p>BEARDSLEY: For NPR News, I'm Eleanor Beardsley in Tunis.</p>
