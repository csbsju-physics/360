<h1> "Fired Coach Donates Michigan Items To Charity" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>Rich Rodriguez, recently fired as the University of Michigan football coach, decided to clear out his closet of everything related to the Wolverines and donate it all to the Wayne, Michigan, Salvation Army.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>Four hundred thirty two items, most of which will be auctioned tomorrow, including Michigan jackets, shirts, hand towels, and this big ticket item says Major John Aaron of the Salvation Army.</p>
    <p>JOHN AARON: (Salvation Army) A hat with the sweatband well used, with his autograph of the visor.</p>
    <p>NORRIS: Hmm, is Aaron afraid Ohio State fans might come and buy something just to burn it afterwards?</p>
    <p>AARON: Yeah. We have got the people around the corner, and if we see the plates coming in from Ohio, well, you know, I really can't tell you too much more about that right now. But we've got the police on high alert, and we're going to be keeping an eye out for those guys.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: The Rich Rodriguez auction will run from noon to 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
