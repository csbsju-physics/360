    <p>From Jerusalem, NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro explains.</p>
    <p>LOURDES GARCIA: Much of what is there was already known. But the documents do reveal that the Palestinians offered to make several major concessions, in talks with the government of the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in 2008. Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem, save one, would fall under Israeli sovereignty. Only a token number of refugees would have the right to return to their homes. Israelis seemingly rejected the offers.</p>
    <p>YASSER ABED RABBO: (Foreign language spoken)</p>
    <p>GARCIA: At a press conference in Ramallah, senior Palestinian official Yasser Abed Rabbo accused al-Jazeera of spreading disinformation, as part of a concerted campaign to undermine the Palestinian Authority.</p>

    <p>GARCIA: Abdul Sattar-Qasim is a professor of political science in the West Bank University of An-Najah.</p>
    <p>ABDUL SATTAR: The Palestinian Authority is just an agent and so many of the Palestinian leaders had been made by the Israeli and the Americans. And they are carrying out an American and Israeli agenda. It's not a Palestinian agenda.</p>
    <p>GARCIA: So far, there's been little reaction to the revelations by the Israeli government. Only Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman spoke out on the radio.</p>
