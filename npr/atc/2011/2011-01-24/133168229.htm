<h1> "Alt.Latino: Addressing The Cultural Divide Through Music" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>And here at NPR, we're taking advantage of the fractured media with a project called Alt.Latino. It's a blog and a podcast hosted by Jasmine Garsd and Felix Contreras. Like many people, they're using the Internet to create a place for music they aren't hearing on the radio. And they tell us what they mean by Latin alternative music.</p>
    <p>JASMINE GARSD: It's not what your parents and grandparents listened to. It's not pure salsa. It's not pure merengue. It's not pure rock.</p>
    <p>FELIX CONTRERAS: It's a mishmash of everything else - rock, hip-hop, electronica. Here are three little short blasts of what could be considered Latin alternative music.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>BEBE: (Singing in foreign language)</p>
    <p>CAIFANES: (Singing in foreign language)</p>
    <p>CHOC QUIB TOWN: (Singing in foreign language)</p>
    <p>GARSD: So we started off with a Spanish artist called Bebe. We heard the Mexican rock en Espanol pioneers Caifanes and, finally, Choc Quib Town.</p>
    <p>CONTRERAS: The messages within the song are just like every other genre.</p>
    <p>GARSD: You know, like, I hate my 9:00 to 5:00 job. I want to break up with my girlfriend.</p>
    <p>CONTRERAS: I want to find a girlfriend.</p>
    <p>GARSD: You know, if you turn on your primetime television, if there is a conversation about Latinos, it's likely going to be about Latinos as a problem. And a lot of times, it's a conversation in which Latinos aren't even participating. As the show progresses, we more and more feel this sense of presenting songs that discuss the Latino experience from a Latino perspective.</p>
    <p>CONTRERAS: And almost always those messages are delivered in Spanish, and that brings us to another factor that can separate cultures that we address in our show - language. We try to go over the lyrics of what the bands are singing. Once people come to the music and they hear it and once they find a place for themselves in the music, then it becomes a lot more accessible, and it's just - it's something that binds people together as opposed to dividing us.</p>
    <p>GARSD: I think we should close this segment out with a song called "Compartir" or "To Share" by Carla Morrison, a young artist from Mexico.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "COMPARTIR")</p>
    <p>CONTRERAS: You know, her music is an example of the interaction of cultures and musical styles. I mean, if she sang in English, her music would be right at home on any number of English language radio playlist.</p>
    <p>GARSD: Okay, not all, just the cool ones, like us.</p>
    <p>CONTRERAS: There you go.</p>
    <p>GARSD: I'm Jasmine Garsd.</p>
    <p>CONTRERAS: And I'm Felix Contreras. Please check us out on Alt.Latino.</p>
