<h1> "Protesters Demand Change In Yemen" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>Those protests in Tunisia have rippled outward in the Arab world, first to Egypt and now to Yemen. Today, thousands of Yemenis protested in the streets of the capital, Sana'a. And Washington Post correspondent Sudarsan Raghavan is there. Sudarsan, you described this rally today as peaceful. Who's out in the streets protesting?</p>
    <p>SUDARSAN RAGHAVAN: Well, it's a pretty boisterous mix of opposition party members, including socialists and Islamists, teachers, professors, students, poor, unemployed workers. So it was a very diverse crowd.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: So a widespread demonstration. What are the demands?</p>
    <p>RAGHAVAN: Well, people are absolutely frustrated about the high unemployment, the low wages, rising prices of food, transportation and widespread corruption. Many were calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down from power. And after 32 years in power, they feel it's a time for change.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: How strong, how stable would you say the Yemeni government is?</p>
    <p>RAGHAVAN: Well, the Yemeni government is quite weak. It controls few areas outside of the capital, where tribal leaders rule. They're facing a rebellion in the north. There's also a secessionist movement in the south. And on top of that all, they're facing a threat from a resurgent al-Qaida affiliate, which is increasingly turning Yemen into a base to target the West and its allies.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: So how do you see this resolving itself? I mean, could this be just the final blow to a government that you describe as really week?</p>
    <p>RAGHAVAN: Well, what was interesting about the protest today is how peaceful and organized they were, unlike the ones in Tunisia and in Egypt, where we saw clashes between the police and activists. There was none of that today.</p>
    <p>In fact, as protestors are leaving a number of them ringed - clasped their hands together and made a ring around the soldiers to prevent any demonstrators from attacking the soldiers.</p>
    <p>So in a way it's sort of a slow-burning protest movement. For instance, you know, they're not planning to protest tomorrow. In fact, they plan to protest next week.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: So in terms of replacing the government as they're demanding, you don't think that's on the horizon, right now at least?</p>
    <p>RAGHAVAN: I mean, the government is trying its best to appease the protestors. President Saleh, in a televised speech, said he would raise the salaries of soldiers, cut income taxes and also promised that he would not anoint his son as his successor, all from the demands of the protestors.</p>
    <p>Certainly, you know, this is a military state, and the army is working with the government. So it's really unclear what's going to happen in the future. Some protestors are telling me that they aren't concerned about a crackdown like what's happening in Egypt. Others say that they're going to continue pressing forward no matter what happens until they get change.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: I've been talking with Washington Post correspondent Sudarsan Raghavan. He's in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen.</p>
    <p>Sudarsan, thanks very much.</p>
