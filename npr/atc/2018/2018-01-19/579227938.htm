<h1> "Dolly Parton Recognized For 2 World Records In Country Music" </h1>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>All right, right now we are going to give it up for Dolly Parton.</p>
    <p>MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: </p>
    <p>That is because yesterday the Guinness World Records recognized her as the female artist with the most hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs charts. She has 106 - 106.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: But wait; there is more from Guinness World Records official adjudicator Michael Furnari.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>DOLLY PARTON: Oh, really?</p>
    <p>MICHAEL FURNARI: You have achieved a second Guinness World title...</p>
    <p>PARTON: (Laughter) Lordy (ph).</p>
    <p>FURNARI: ...For the most decades with a Top 20 hit on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.</p>
    <p>KELLY: Dolly Parton beat out George Jones, Reba McEntire, even the king, Elvis Presley. She landed 20 top hits in six decades.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: We need to hear some of those songs. They start in the '60s.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SOMETHING FISHY")</p>
    <p>PARTON: (Singing) I think there's something fishy going on.</p>
    <p>KELLY: Then we're on to the '70s.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "JOLENE")</p>
    <p>PARTON: (Singing) Jolene, Jolene.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Best song ever. Then the '80s.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "9 TO 5")</p>
    <p>PARTON: (Singing) Working 9 to 5.</p>
    <p>KELLY: I'm going to make a case for that one, "9 to 5," as best song ever. But we're on to the '90s.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU")</p>
    <p>DOLLY PARTON AND VINCE GILL: (Singing) I will always love you.</p>
    <p>KELLY: Fun fact, by the way, Kelly - "I Will Always Love You" made the Hot Country chart in three different decades. Dolly soloed with it in 1974, she used it for a medley in '82, and then she sang it with Vince Gill. That was in 1995.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Wow. All right, so moving on to the 2000s and a duet with Brad Paisley.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "WHEN I GET WHERE I'M GOING")</p>
    <p>DOLLY PARTON AND BRAD PAISLEY: (Singing) Yeah, when I get where I'm going...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "JOLENE")</p>
    <p>DOLLY PARTON AND PENTATONIX: (Singing) Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.</p>
    <p>KELLY: And that's Dolly Parton's most recent hit. She reworked "Jolene" with Pentatonix a couple years ago.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>PARTON: It's a good feeling to know that I've had hit songs in - through all those decades. It makes me feel like I'm about a hundred, which it won't be long till I am.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Actually, it will be a long time. Dolly Parton turns 72 today.</p>
    <p>KELLY: Happy birthday, Dolly. And please keep the hits coming.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "JOLENE")</p>
    <p>PARTON: (Singing) Your smile is like a breath of spring. Your voice is soft like summer rain. I cannot compete with you, Jolene. He talks about you in his sleep. There's nothing I can do to keep from crying when he calls your name, Jolene.</p>
