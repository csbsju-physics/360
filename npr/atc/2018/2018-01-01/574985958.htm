<h1> "Women Star In 2017 Blockbusters" </h1>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>For Hollywood, 2017 was not a great year for the box office. But there was one interesting thing - in 2017, movies led by women took the top three spots for the highest-grossing movies in the U.S. and Canada. No. 1, "Star Wars."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LIGHTSABER)</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: "The Last Jedi" had four leading ladies, including young Rey trying to find her way with the force.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII - THE LAST JEDI")</p>
    <p>DAISY RIDLEY: (As Rey) I need someone to show me my place in all this.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: The No. 2 movie was the live-action remake of "Beauty And The Beast" starring Emma Watson as Belle, another woman looking for something more exciting.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST")</p>
    <p>EMMA WATSON: (As Belle, singing) There goes the baker with his tray like always...</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: And rounding out the top three Gal Godot as Wonder Woman.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "WONDER WOMAN")</p>
    <p>GAL GADOT: (As Diana) If no one else will defend the world then I must.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: This is the first time since 1958 that so many movies led by women topped the box office in a single year. That's according to Alicia Malone, a correspondent at Fandango.</p>
    <p>ALICIA MALONE: Hollywood seems to have amnesia when it comes to the success of women. It's a surprise every time it happens, and then quickly it fades away and they continue with male-led movies.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Women dominated not just the box office, but many of the Oscar contenders, too, movies like "Lady Bird"...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "LADY BIRD")</p>
    <p>SAOIRSE RONAN: (As Lady Bird McPherson) I want to go where culture is, like New York...</p>
    <p>LAURIE METCALF: (As Marion McPherson) And how in the world did I raise such a snob?</p>
    <p>RONAN: (As Lady Bird McPherson) ...Or at least Connecticut or New Hampshire.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: ..."The Shape Of Water"...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE SHAPE OF WATER")</p>
    <p>OCTAVIA SPENCER: (As Zelda Fuller) I answer mostly on account of she can't talk. Mute, sir.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: ...And "The Post."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE POST")</p>
    <p>MERYL STREEP: (As Kay Graham) We can't hold them accountable if we don't have a newspaper.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Alicia Malone of Fandango says all these leading women driving ticket sales and critical success, this was not a coincidence.</p>
    <p>MALONE: This shows that audiences are really hungry for seeing women in the lead roles. And I hope that Hollywood listens and this becomes more of a trend and we see more opportunities for women in the future.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Malone says the future could be as soon as this year with movies like "Ocean's 8" and "A Wrinkle In Time" in the pipeline.</p>
