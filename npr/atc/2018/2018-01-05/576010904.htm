<h1> "Robert Siegel Superfans Say Farewell To 'All Things Considered' Host" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>Well, Robert...</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>Yeah.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: This is it...</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: This is it.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: ...Your last day as host of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED after 30 years.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Yeah.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Listeners have a lot of thoughts and feelings about this milestone, and we wanted to take a moment to hear from some of them. So our co-hosts Audie Cornish and Kelly McEvers joined me to help.</p>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>Hey there, Robert. You know, the listeners we heard from - they come from all walks of life.</p>
    <p>EURDORA EVANS: I'm a truck driver with my husband.</p>
    <p>HELMAR MENZ: Speech therapist.</p>
    <p>KELLY PURDUE: A hospice social worker.</p>
    <p>JOHN B COOPER: I am 74 and retired.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: And they say they'll miss a lot of things about you, Robert, one thing most of all. Here's Eurdora Evans of Harvey, La., and Kelly Purdue of Grand Rapids.</p>
    <p>EVANS: He has a soothing voice to me. Like, it's not soothing where it would put you to sleep, but it's just really calm.</p>
    <p>PURDUE: And kind of all is right in the world.</p>
    <p>MENZ: There was just always something welcoming about turning on the radio, you know, at 3 or 4 p.m. and having him be the first voice that I hear, you know, right after the news.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: That's Helmar Menz of Portland, Ore.</p>
    <p>MENZ: He is kind of a father figure. You know, I don't know him as a person, but just the range of introspection that listening to his voice allows, I do think that it was kind of - some kind of father figure over the radio, honestly, over the last 20 years. And that's probably part of why I'll feel especially affected by his departure.</p>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>Over and over, people told us how it's more than your voice; it is your presence that has meant so much. Kelly Purdue feels it. She has been listening over 25 years.</p>
    <p>PURDUE: Being a hospice social worker, I have hard days that are sad and difficult. But as I drive in my car, going about my daily tasks, visiting with patients and families who are dying, Robert was my companion. He made my day better.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: And it's not just adults. Generations of backseat NPR listeners grew up hearing your voice, two of them Zaden and Kaia Eby-Holmes from Fishers, Ind. They're brother and sister, 16 and 15 years old.</p>
    <p>ZADEN EBY-HOLMES: When my mom would just drive us places she'd just have NPR on. And I'd hear the name Robert Siegel, and I thought the last name was great, you know, 'cause, like, we thought he was a bird.</p>
    <p>KAIA EBY-HOLMES: (Laughter).</p>
    <p>EBY-HOLMES: And we'd hear, hi, I'm Robert Siegel, and you're listening to NPR, and we'd just freak out. Take us somewhere. Fly us away.</p>
    <p>KAIA: I was just really bummed out that, like, no one, like, not even, like, my kids are going to be able to hear him in a whole bunch of years, to feel the joy of his voice and laugh at his name and everything.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF GLENN MILLER'S "IN THE MOOD")</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: People trapped in cars appreciate you, Robert.</p>
    <p>GREG GUNGOR ATMACA: My name is Greg Gungor Atmaca. I am listening Robert over 15 years.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: That's the Turkish Lyft driver who picked you up this summer during a reporting trip in Boston. He didn't recognize you at first, but once you started talking, he knew exactly who you were.</p>
    <p>ATMACA: He was great that he asked me questions. And we exchanged opinions. It was perfect. And I enjoyed it so much. And I will never forget that the rest of my life.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF RED GARLAND'S "ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE")</p>
    <p>PURDUE: Oh, Robert, I'd like to say thank you.</p>
    <p>EVANS: Robert, thank you so much.</p>
    <p>KAIA: Thank you.</p>
    <p>EBY-HOLMES: Thank you so much for making me and my sister happy when we were in the back seat of a car.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Robert, thank you from your co-hosts.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Thank you, Robert.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Thank you, Robert. And we want to end on this - a wish from John B. Cooper of Colorado. He's listened to you since you were Bob Siegel 40 years ago.</p>
    <p>COOPER: When that mic goes dead, I will hope that he moves on to a great adventure and a wonderful life because he has enriched my life. And I've been so proud to be able to be a listener over all these years.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF RED GARLAND'S "ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE")</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Well, I'm bowled over and speechless, Ari.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Hopefully not so speechless that you can't round out the segment right now.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: I can say it. This is NPR News.</p>
