<h1> "Professors Suggest 'Baby Bonds' Could Fix Widening Inequality In The U.S." </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>What if every baby born in the United States was a trust fund baby? That's what two economics professors are proposing, that Uncle Sam provide each American newborn with a trust fund. The amount would vary depending on the parent's wealth, with an average of about $20,000. NPR's John Ydstie reports the professors floating this idea say it could help boost opportunity.</p>
    <p>JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Duke University professor William Darity Jr. says there's a huge wealth gap in the United States. He points out that the richest 1 percent of Americans hold nearly 40 percent of the nation's wealth. Meanwhile, nearly a third of Americans have no accumulated wealth outside the value of their home. And wealth gives you opportunity, says professor Darity.</p>
    <p>WILLIAM DARITY JR: Wealthier families have the capacity to purchase homes in higher amenity neighborhoods. They have the capacity to provide their kids with higher quality education.</p>
    <p>YDSTIE: And he says wealthier families have assets they can draw on to handle emergencies like the loss of a job or a serious medical condition, emergencies that can devastate families with no assets. Darity says there's often a bias against providing help for those struggling families because they're viewed as having been irresponsible or having made bad choices. That's why he says providing a trust fund for infants makes sense.</p>
    <p>DARITY JR: You can't blame the infants for the condition that they are born into. And so let's do something about that when they have an opportunity to reach adulthood.</p>
    <p>YDSTIE: Darity and his partner, Darrick Hamilton of The New School in New York City, suggests providing trust funds of between $500 and $50,000, depending on the wealth of the family. The trust funds would be guaranteed to grow at the rate of inflation plus 1 percent a year. When a child reached 18 years of age, he or she would get access to the funds.</p>
    <p>DARITY JR: My general impulse is to be non-paternalistic and to give the young people as much discretion as possible. I think it would be vital in this context for them to be given training and preparation for management of their accounts.</p>
    <p>YDSTIE: Darity acknowledges that politically it might be necessary to limit use of the funds to things like paying for education, purchasing a home or starting a business. Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University, is skeptical of the idea. He thinks the money would be more useful for children at a younger age.</p>
    <p>TYLER COWEN: By the time a lot of people reach 18, they're already in quite a disadvantaged position. So I would instead prefer to extend the earned income tax credit, say, for working parents who had young children at home. I think that would help more.</p>
    <p>YDSTIE: The earned income tax credit, which supplements low-wage work, has been part of the U.S. social safety net since 1975. Cowen is also skeptical of giving the money to 18-year-olds.</p>
    <p>COWEN: I don't think there's a case for arguing we would do better to let everyone be spending the money at 18. That's really the age when you're often most irresponsible.</p>
    <p>YDSTIE: Professor Darity says he'd be open to delaying access to the trust fund until the young adults are a bit older. As for just increasing the earned income tax credit, Darity says that's an income program that doesn't necessarily build wealth, which is the focus of his proposal.</p>
    <p>DARITY JR: Wealth gives you a much wider range of opportunities and options than income. Wealthier families can have a greater impact on the political process. Greater economic wealth gives you greater civic wealth.</p>
    <p>YDSTIE: Darity says he estimates his proposal would cost around $80 billion a year, or about 2 percent of the federal budget. But he argues it would increase skills, investment and business creation that would boost the economy. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.</p>
