    <p>From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. </p>

    <p>Now to the story of a popular educator from California who was brutally murdered in Mexico. Last week, 33-year-old Bobby Salcedo was visiting relatives in Durango, Mexico. He was abducted by a gang of armed men, and he was killed. Now, the FBI is likely to join the investigation. </p>
    <p>As NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, Salcedo's death has devastated his hometown of El Monte, just outside Los Angeles. </p>
    <p>CARRIE KAHN: El Monte is a working-class, largely immigrant community, and Bobby Salcedo was one of its role models. He was a product of the town's public schools who later came back to teach. He became an assistant principal and eventually was elected to the school board. </p>
    <p>El Monte Mayor Andre Quintero says Salcedo gave everything to his town. </p>
    <p>Mayor ANDRE QUINTERO (El Monte, California): There was nothing selfish about this young man. And he was just a bright, shining star for our community, and it's just a tragic loss. </p>
    <p>KAHN: Salcedo is believed to be the first elected U.S. official caught up in the violence of Mexico's ongoing drug war. Last week, Salcedo was vacationing in Durango, Mexico, with his wife in her hometown, Gomez Palacio. They were out with friends at a local bar when gunmen burst in and kidnapped Salcedo and five other men. The next day, all were found dead, their bodies dumped alongside a canal. Mexican authorities say it looks like the work of a drug gang. Salcedo's family says Bobby was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p>
    <p>His brother, Juan, says Bobby has been traveling to Gomez Palacio for years without problems. </p>
    <p>Mr. JUAN SALCEDO: He did a lot of fundraisers for that city - I mean, as ironic as it is - fundraising for orphanages, fire department, an ambulance for that city. </p>
    <p>KAHN: Salcedo and his wife, Betzy, were married there just a year and a half ago. Speaking in Spanish, she said she's devastated by the loss of her husband. Bobby's sister, Griselda, translated. </p>
    <p>Ms. BETZY SALCEDO: (Foreign language spoken) </p>
    <p>Ms. GRISELDA SALCEDO JEFFERSON: I would like people to remember him as a great educator. Education was, he believed, the solution to our problems. </p>
    <p>KAHN: The women said Salcedo's main goal in life was to inspire young people and help them get into college. He appeared to achieve that goal, according to the thousands of people who filled El Monte's high school football field last night to remember Salcedo. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of a marching band) </p>
    <p>KAHN: The school marching band played their fight song as speaker after speaker told stories of Salcedo's incredible drive and commitment to the youth of El Monte. </p>
    <p>Students like Crystal Delgado wrote remembrances on dozens of poster boards hanging from the football field fence. </p>
    <p>Ms. CRYSTAL DELGADO: He wasn't just a teacher, he was a friend. He was always there for us. And especially when I needed help, like on my college apps, he was there helping me. He was someone great who I'm always going to remember. </p>
    <p>KAHN: Delgado was in Mexico when she heard about Salcedo's murder. She says she's much more cautious in Mexico now than ever before. </p>
    <p>Jose Barrajas, who was also at the rally, says he no longer travels home to Mexico. </p>
    <p>Mr. JOSE BARRAJAS: (Foreign language spoken) </p>
    <p>KAHN: He says Mexico isn't like it used to be. You don't know who is good, or who is bad. </p>
    <p>Salcedo's relatives say they have no confidence that Mexican officials will find Bobby's killers. They urged everyone at the rally to call their congressmen and put pressure on Mexico so that their loss, and that of El Monte's, won't be in vain. </p>
