    <p>And Im Madeleine Brand. </p>
    <p>Toward the end of a State of the Union address that focused on jobs and the economy, President Obama had this to say. </p>
    <p>President BARACK OBAMA: This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of cheering and applause) </p>
    <p>BRAND: The president was talking about the 1993 law known as Dont Ask, Dont Tell that prohibits gays from serving openly in the military. </p>
    <p>NPRs Tom Bowman reports on just how hard itll be to change. </p>
    <p>TOM BOWMAN: President Obama has vowed to end Dont Ask, Dont Tell before. So last night, gay rights advocates like Aubrey Sarvis were hoping for something more. </p>
    <p>Mr. AUBREY SARVIS (Executive Director, Servicemembers Legal Defense Network): I would have liked to have heard more specifics. </p>
    <p>BOWMAN: Sarvis heads the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a group created to end Dont Ask, Dont Tell. </p>
    <p>Mr. SARVIS: But weve come to learn in the past year that thats not the presidents style. </p>
    <p>BOWMAN: One person taking the lead in Congress is Representative Patrick Murphy. Hes a Pennsylvania Democrat and Iraq war veteran. Murphy says Dont Ask, Dont Tell is forcing good people out of ranks - helicopter mechanics, Arab linguists, medics, at a time when polls show strong support inside the military for repeal. But Murphy lacks enough support in Congress. He has 187 supporters to change the law, but he needs dozens more for majority. </p>
    <p>Representative PATRICK MURPHY (Democrat, Pennsylvania): Washington now is a tough place to make change happen. </p>
    <p>BOWMAN: There was no Senate sponsor for this. Doesnt that tell you that it does lack political support? </p>
    <p>Rep. MURPHY: I think Congress needs to get a backbone. Its up to Congress to overturn that law. Its not even the presidents responsibility. </p>
    <p>BOWMAN: Congress is looking to the military for advice. But the Joint Chiefs are decidedly cool to repealing the law while fighting two wars. They fear allowing gays to serve openly could harm morale, even cause some sergeants and officers to resign. Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said last year he favors a go slow approach even if Dont Ask, Dont Tell comes to an end. </p>
    <p>Admiral MIKE MULLEN (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staffs): Should this occur, I think we need to implement it in a way that recognizes the challenges and the stress that were under right now. </p>
    <p>BOWMAN: The White House is looking at several options. One calls for attaching the repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell to the annual defense bill, a measure Congress must pass. Another option: keep the law, but carry it out in a more humane way. That means making it harder to kick someone out just for being gay. </p>
