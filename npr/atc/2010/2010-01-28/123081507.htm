    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>Tomorrow on MORNING EDITION we'll have more on the London conference. We'll have an interview with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. </p>
    <p>Secretary HILLARY CLINTON (Department of State): It is for me just the beginning and how it goes will be a little bit like jazz. I mean, we're not sure. I can't lay it out completely. We know that, you know, we're not going to be making peace with people who are still trying to kill us and kill Afghans and send suicide bombers and do the, you know, horrific, barbaric acts that they do to kill and intimidate people. </p>
    <p>But there are a lot of members of the Taliban who want out. </p>
    <p>BRAND: The full interview with Secretary Clinton tomorrow on MORNING EDITION. </p>
