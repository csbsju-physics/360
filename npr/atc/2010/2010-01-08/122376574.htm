<h1> "Vice President Biden's Mother Dies" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>Now, a moment to remember Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden. She was known to family and friends as Jean, and better known to most of us as the mother of Vice President Joe Biden. Mrs. Biden passed away today. She was 92. In 2008, at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Joe Biden told stories about his mother as she smiled from the audience.</p>
    <p>V: As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly would look at me and tell me, Joey, it's because you're so bright, you can't get the thoughts out quickly enough.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>V: When I was not as well dressed as the other kids, she'd look at me and say, Joey, oh, you're so handsome, honey, you're so handsome.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>BLOCK: In a statement today, Vice President Biden said this of his mother: Her strength, which was immeasurable, will live on in all of us.</p>
