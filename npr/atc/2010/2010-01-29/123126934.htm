    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, Host: </p>
    <p>We have an update now in a story from Monday's program. Our co-host Melissa Block reported from Lake Placid, New York on a World Cup ski cross race. That's where four skiers at a time race down a twisty course full of bumps and jumps.</p>
    <p>Ski cross is making its Olympic debut in Vancouver next month. It's both thrilling and dangerous. And as Melissa reported, a French skier at that world cup race had a terrible accident. Florent Astier careened off the course. He was medevaced out and doctors feared he might be paralyzed.</p>

    <p>Well today, Melissa has learned that the 23-year-old skier is, in fact, paralyzed from the chest and shoulder area down after suffering a C5 vertebra fracture and several spinal cord injury.</p>
    <p>Doctors treating Mr. Astier at Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington, Vermont, say it's too early to project his long-term outcome. Mr. Astier's family is with him at the hospital.</p>
    <p>Joe Fitzgerald, the race director for the International Ski Federation, FIS, says this is the most serious accident they've ever had in seven years of ski cross world cup races. He added, it is very unfortunate, we're all very sad for him.</p>
