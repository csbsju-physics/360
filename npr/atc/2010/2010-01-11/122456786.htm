<h1> "Workers With Best, Worst Jobs Compare Notes" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, host: </p>
    <p>A survey about jobs was released earlier this month. It rated the best and the worst among 200 jobs. </p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>The survey was conducted by the job search company, CareerCast. It looked at five factors: stress, work environment, physical demands, income and hiring outlook. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: The results: actuaries were at the top. At the bottom, roustabouts, the people with the dirtiest jobs in the oil business, operating and cleaning oil rigs. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Well, that's what the numbers showed. But then there is subjective experience. Karen DeToro is a consulting actuary in Chicago. She advises life insurance companies about risk. Adam Henry is a roustabout in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana. And we got these two strangers to talk to each other. </p>
    <p>Ms. KAREN DETORO (Consulting Actuary, Chicago): So, Adam, when did you first decide that this was what you wanted to pursue? </p>
    <p>Mr. ADAM HENRY (Roustabout, Gulf of Mexico): Well, it's been something I've - even in grade school I did book reports and such on. </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: Wow, that's great. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: Yeah. How did you end up in your present occupation, Karen? </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: Well, when I was in college, I actually just decided to major in math, didn't necessarily have a plan for what I was going to do with it. And frankly, I had some student loans I needed to pay back and I needed to get a job, found out about this career, applied for and got a job. And I thought it would be a short term thing until I could get those loans paid off. But it turned out to be something I really enjoyed. I've worked at a few different employers in the field and so I've gotten to see some different aspects of it. I love what I do for a living. And so, it was very gratifying to see that this survey reflected a lot of the same positives that I see in my job. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: In my situation, you want to escape, you know, if you're a roustabout in a drill camp or on a drill ship you're in an area where you're in seclusion. To me, that's an exciting adventure. </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: Right, and that's very different. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: And it's dirty work, you know. You wear coveralls, all kinds of safety equipment. </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: There are certainly some things about my job that people wouldn't find appealing. You know, we do a lot of work with numbers. Certainly that's not something that everyone is interested in. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: I'm always thinking in my own mind that it's work always indoors and I've never been very good at that. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: Well, I will tell you I get to travel a lot for my job. And so, when I get to where I'm going, I'm going into a client's office and working indoors again. But I like the days where I'm running to the airport or I'm driving from my office to a client in the middle of the day. I do like having that opportunity to get out of the office during the day. But I would say, I don't think I would take it to the extreme that you do. I don't think it's something that I would be capable of doing. So, I'm happy that there are guys like you who do do it. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: Yeah. Two nights ago, we had dolphins all around the ship. It was a nice quiet night. The water was like glass. And the dolphins were just swimming around, feeding in the lights around the ship. </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: Well, Adam, it was a pleasure talking with you. Best of luck. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: Thank you, Karen. </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: Okay, thank you very much. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: All right. </p>
    <p>Ms. DETORO: Bye. </p>
    <p>Mr. HENRY: Bye. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: That was roustabout Adam Henry taking with actuary Karen DeToro about their personal experiences with what one survey found to be the best job and the worst job. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song, "Roustabout") </p>
    <p>Mr. ELVIS PRESLEY (Singer): (Singing) I'm just a roustabout shiftin' from town to town. No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy. There's a lot of space beneath that sky till I find my place there's no doubt, I'll be a roving roustabout. Call me the carefree kindï¿½ </p>
