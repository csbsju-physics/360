<h1> "Early Snow Kills Many State Budgets" </h1>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>It has already been a brutal winter in many parts of this country and we are only a month into it. It costs a lot of money to keep streets clear of snow and ice. </p>
    <p>As Iowa Public Radio's Rob Dillard reports, some cities have already exhausted their entire snow removal budgets. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of snow blower) </p>
    <p>ROB DILLARD: On East 6th Street in downtown Des Moines, work crews are doing what they call snow loading. An enormous blower inches along a normally busy thoroughfare, sucking up mounds of dirty snow from curbsides and dumping it into trucks to be hauled away from downtown. </p>
    <p>Des Moines Public Works Director Bill Stowe says it's a difficult and expensive job. </p>
    <p>Mr. BILL STOWE (Public Works Director, Des Moines): This kind of event for a couple square miles here in the downtown cost nearly a half million dollars each time we do it. We've done it twice now in the last month. So it's a very expensive situation. Typically, in a normal winter we would not do it once, let alone, twice. </p>
    <p>DILLARD: One problem for Stowe is that he's already blown through the $3 million the city budget had for snow removal for the entire year. </p>
    <p>Mr. STOWE: We're now at a point where we're basically moving it from long-term maintenance accounts over into snow and ice control just to be able to clear the streets and make them safe in the winter. </p>
    <p>DILLARD: Des Moines has been buried by three blizzards so far this season, dropping more than 30 inches on the ground twice the normal accumulation. It's been a severe winter in many parts of the country. Ice and snow removal budgets have been depleted in cities and counties nationwide. Kansas City already spent the $2.5 million it allocated for snow removal and now expects to spend as much as $4 million. Officials in Colorado Springs say they won't even bother plowing residential streets until at least six inches fall. </p>
    <p>The village of Genesee, Wisconsin with a population of just 7,500 set aside $300,000 for snow removal and that's already gone. The town's clerk, Barbara Whitmore, says it's had to cut back a bit on service. </p>
    <p>Ms. BARBARA WHITMORE (Clerk, Genesee, Wisconsin): This year we're looking more at only doing the stop areas, curbs and hills. </p>
    <p>DILLARD: Every year the Washington, D.C. based American Public Works Association sponsors a conference where the heads of public works departments discuss the latest in snow and ice removal. A couple of years ago, many griped about the high cost of salt. The group's executive director, Peter King, says he has a feel for what they'll be talking about this year. </p>
    <p>Mr. PETER KING (Executive Director, American Public Works Association): I'm thinking it's probably going to be more focused on predictions and how the public safety can be protected when the budget shortfall comes into play. </p>
    <p>DILLARD: Meanwhile, back on the streets of Des Moines, public works director Bill Stowe is done with predictions. </p>
    <p>Mr. STOWE: We were actually told by distinguished climatologists, including the state climatologist that this would be a relatively easy winter. Clearly, that prognostication didn't work very well. So, we've kind of lost our reliance on long-term forecasts. </p>
    <p>DILLARD: In a typical year, which this is not, Des Moines will receive another 20 inches of snow between now and the last snowflake. </p>
