<h1> "A Cringe Moment For Brown's 'Available' Daughter" </h1>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>Why use eHarmony or Match.com when there is your dad? </p>
    <p>Senator-elect SCOTT BROWN (Republican, Massachusetts): So, I want to thank Ayla and Arianna for their help as well. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of applause) </p>
    <p>BRAND: That's Massachusetts Senator-elect Scott Brown during his acceptance speech Tuesday night. Ayla and Arianna are his daughters but that's not all they are. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of applause) </p>
    <p>Sen. BROWN: And just in case anybody who is watching throughout the country, yes, they're both available. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of applause) </p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>To some, that was kind of sweet, one of those oh, Dad moments. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of crowd) </p>
    <p>Sen. BROWN: Only kidding, only kidding. Arianna is definitely not available, but Ayla is. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>BLOCK: To others, it was awkward, and to conservative talk show host Glenn Beck it was suspect. </p>
    <p>Mr. GLENN BECK (Host, "The Glenn Beck Program"): I want a chastity belt on this man. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. BECK: I want his every move watched in Washington. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. BECK: I don't trust this guy. No I'm just telling you, it's just a creepy moment. </p>
    <p>BRAND: Ayla Brown, the available daughter, says there's nothing creepy about her dad's comments, though she did admit to being slightly embarrassed. The senator-elects older daughter is not new to the national stage. She is a former "American Idol" contestant and she plays basketball for Boston College. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: She is also a little busy these days with her Facebook page. Ayla Brown says she received more than a 1,000 friend requests after her father's acceptance speech  mostly from single men. </p>
