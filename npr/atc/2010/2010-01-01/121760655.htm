<h1> "An Ode To The Voice Of The Navajo Nation Station" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, host: </p>
    <p>The usual end-of-year obits tend to focus on the passing of famous actors, politicians, inventors - notables, we call them. Well, today, in the final part of our Obituaries series, we mark the passing of someone who was an anchor of his community - notable for so many reasons, but not famous. </p>
    <p>Ernie Manuelito died this year at the age of 57, after almost 40 years behind a microphone. When Ernie spoke in English or in Navajo, his voice carried across the Red Rock Desert and into the ears of the Navajo nation. </p>
    <p>Mr. PAUL JONES (News Director, KTNN Radio): Ernie's voice was very familiar, just like the voice of Walter Cronkite. He was the first voice that came on the air when the radio station started here in Window Rock. </p>
    <p>Mr. ERNIE MANUELITO (Broadcast Journalist): Good evening. I'm Ernie Manuelito with KTNN radio station, and one of the... </p>
    <p>Mr. JONES: And he stayed on here with us until he left us. My name is Paul Jones, and I am the news director here at KTNN radio station. When he first came, he was a disc jockey. He got promoted here and there in different areas. </p>
    <p>Ms. ELLIE WILLIAMS: The weather, to the news, to hosting the oldies shows and sports. </p>
    <p>Mr. JONES: I understand he worked in the sales department, too, for a while. So he was a jack of all trades. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Singer: (Singing) The voice of the Navajo nation, KTNN. </p>
    <p>Ms. WILLIAMS: Radio is very important. It's everyday life of what's going on throughout the Navajo reservation, a remote area. My name is Ellie Williams. If you're herding sheep out there, they'll have their portable radio, or they're in their vehicle listening to the ball game. </p>
    <p>These are all like, old - these are old - here we go. Let's go in and listen to them, and you'll know who Ernie Manuelito is. </p>
    <p>Mr. MANUELITO: Troy Aikman (Navajo spoken). </p>
    <p>Ms. WILLIAMS: Ernie and I sat down together and talked about football because people on the reservation, a majority of them have never been to an NFL game, so we have to be very descriptive. OK, how do we explain a touchdown? </p>
    <p>Mr. MANUELITO: (Navajo spoken) This time, it's going to be goodbye, touchdown, Dallas Cowboys. </p>
    <p>Ms. WILLIAMS: (Navajo spoken), you know, is touchdown. (Navajo spoken) is the pigskin. (Navajo spoken), getting the pigskin ready so that the - because it's so cold. It's almost like storytelling. </p>
    <p>Mr. MANUELITO: (Navajo spoken) </p>
    <p>Ms. WILLIAMS: (Navajo spoken) says that he ran across like a fast rabbit. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Mr. MANUELITO: Dallas Cowboys (Navajo spoken). </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song, "Why Don't You Love Me") </p>
    <p>Mr. JONES: I used to call him Early Bird Ernie. I always used to promote his show, every Friday, to tune into Early Bird Ernie. He's going to be playing your oldies, and a lot of people listening in. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song, "Why Don't You Love Me") </p>
    <p>Mr. HANK WILLIAMS (Musician): (Singing) Why don't you love me like you used to do? </p>
    <p>Ms. WILLIAMS: It's five o'clock. (Navajo spoken). Five o'clock, KTNN. And then Ernie would be on the radio. </p>
    <p>Mr. RAY SOSI(ph): You would think that people would still be asleep; nope, they're up, listening to Ernie. </p>
    <p>Mr. JONES: The old country music stars, like Porter Wagoner or Dolly Parton, when they were young. And yeah, there was Conway Twitty. </p>
    <p>Mr. SOSI: Country and a little bit on the wild side, back when we were young, when our hearts were young. That's how he put it. My name is Ray Sosi. How would I put it? Protege of Ernie Manuelito, out here on the reservation. Radio was more or less like a mental television. They compare it with the movie stars. Your voice, you're almost worshipped. </p>
    <p>Mr. HARRISON DEHAYA(ph): I heard Ernie on the radio, and I always thought, what kind of a person is he? How does he look like? Is he big? He sounds big. He sounds like heavyset guy. He sounds tall. </p>
    <p>Mr. JONES: We are at the KTNN radio station programming department. This is our engineering office, and that's where - we call it Ernie's office, or we call it Ernie's dungeon. And inside, you will see his desk where he left it, how he left it. </p>
    <p>Mr. DEHAYA: It's just another vacant office to me. But some people like - with - that are deep into native tradition, they get scared of things like that. They think something spooky is in there. </p>
    <p>Mr. SOSI: One thing that I know is he's still around. And every now and then, I get a chance to sit in his chair, just to be near him. </p>
    <p>Mr. MANUELITO: (Navajo spoken) </p>
    <p>Mr. SOSI: I have an understanding of how far our signal goes. It's actually endless. You know how you throw a rock into a pond? Well, our voice travels in radio waves, and that radio waves spreads out so that signal, the voices that he sent, is still out there travelling outward from the earth. </p>
    <p>Mr. MANUELITO: Good night from Window Rock cinema, right here in Window Rock, Arizona. That's going to do it for the forum tonight. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of music) </p>
    <p>NORRIS: Ernie Manuelito died of a respiratory ailment on April 10th, 2009. Posey Gruener produced our tribute. Thanks to Paul Jones, Ellie Williams, Ray Sosi, Harrison Dehaya and Ann Manuelito for sharing their memories. </p>
