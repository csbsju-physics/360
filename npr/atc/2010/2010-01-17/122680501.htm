    <p>This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Guy Raz. </p>

    <p>Unidentified Group: (Singing) (Unintelligible). </p>
    <p>RAZ: The choir this morning at the Vermont Avenue Baptist Church here in Washington, D.C. It was there where a 27-year-old preacher, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered a speech in 1956, just weeks after the Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of the buses in Montgomery, Alabama. </p>
    <p>Today, it was where President Obama paid tribute to King and where he reflected on the past year. Wednesday marks the first anniversary of Mr. Obama's inauguration. </p>
    <p>President BARACK OBAMA: There was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath. Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled. </p>
    <p>RAZ: This hour, we'll take a look at the president's year in office, his challenges ahead, and why one historian believes Mr. Obama owes his rise in part to the Black Power movement. </p>
