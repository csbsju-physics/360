<h1> "Letters: Iggy Pop" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, host: </p>
    <p>Finally this hour, some of your comments on yesterday's program. Our new series, 50 Great Voices, sparked debate at npr.org about what great means. </p>
    <p>MADELEINE BRAND, host: </p>
    <p>Yesterday's voice was that of Iggy Pop. We said he proved a voice could be a weapon. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song, "Search & Destroy") </p>
    <p>Mr. IGGY POP (Singer): (Singing) I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm. I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb. </p>
    <p>BRAND: Iggy Pop's voice took Dennis Vasilesku(ph) of Chicago back to his youth, well, not back so far. He's not that old. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: He writes: I'm 25 and first listened to him when I was 20. To me, Iggy Pop is musical nihilism, combining childish mischief with adult ennui and teenage contempt. Hearing his music, it's like his voice slouches down, yawns and puts its arm around you. </p>
    <p>BRAND: Oh, give me a break. That was the response from Mike Whitsett(ph) of Spring, Texas. He posted this comment at our Web site: Iggy Pop is one of the 50 greatest voices? I can hardly wait for the other 49. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: We should note the series is officially 50 Great Voices, not 50 greatest voices. </p>
    <p>BRAND: Well, Whitsett continues his critique: Iggy Pop never used his voice as a weapon. He used his stage antics, his pose as a provocateur to crowds, and his outrageous and public substance abuse to get attention. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Well, beyond your assessments of Iggy Pop's greatness or lack thereof, we also received a lot of comments like this one from Kim Weiss(ph) of Boynton Beach, Florida. She writes: I found it ironic that you aired almost no singing of his, lots of talking, a few background shouts here and there. But if you're touting a great voice, wouldn't you want your audience to hear it? </p>
    <p>BRAND: All right, you asked for it, you got it. We'll let Iggy Pop's voice carry us out of this segment. Thanks for your emails and your comments posted at our Web site, npr.org. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of song, "No Fun") </p>
    <p>Mr. POP: (Singing) Well, maybe go out, maybe stay home. Well, maybe call Mom on the telephone. Well, come on. Well, come on. Well, come on. Well, come on. Well, come on. </p>
    <p>SIEGEL: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. </p>
