<h1> "Africa's Soccer Tourney Takes Guinea's Mind Off Ebola" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>Today, the people of Guinea tried to forget about Ebola for just one day. They focused instead on soccer. That's because Guinea's national squad played Ivory Coast in Africa's premier soccer championship. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton watched the match with a group of fans.</p>
    <p>OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: At a ramshackle Atlantic Ocean view cubbyhole in Guinea's capital, Conakry, a few dozen women and men squeeze into the room, breaking Ebola's cardinal rule about no contact, no touching. The focus was Guinea's opening game against Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
    <p>(CHEERING)</p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: The tiny room erupted in euphoria as Guinea scored, and Guinea's National Elephants went ahead of Ivory Coast Elephants, as the teams are called.</p>
    <p>(CHEERING)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MEN: (Chanting in foreign language).</p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: But you can't quite get away from Ebola in Guinea. Excited fans chanted FC Ebola - i.e. Ebola Football Club, adding Ebola must go.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MEN: (Chanting in foreign language).</p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: And then shock - Ivory Coast scored in the 72nd minute. The Guinean fans looked deflated and the match ended in 1-1 draw.</p>
    <p>So, sir, Guinea was ahead.</p>
    <p>MOHAMED CONDE: (Foreign language spoken).</p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: Mohamed Conde says, "oh, well, we were hoping that Guinea would win, but I'm really proud of my team."</p>
    <p>CONDE: (Foreign language spoken).</p>
    <p>QUIST-ARCTON: Conde says, "long live Guinea and out with Ebola." Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, NPR News in Conakry.</p>
