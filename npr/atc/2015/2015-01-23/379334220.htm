<h1> "Goodbye, Garden Yeti: In-Flight Catalog SkyMall Files For Bankruptcy" </h1>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>SkyMall, the glossy in-flight catalog you can't miss or resist, has filed for bankruptcy. The company cites in-flight Wi-Fi and intense online shopping competition for falling sales.</p>
    <p>NPR's Elise Hu looks back.</p>
    <p>ELISE HU, BYLINE: If no one buys SkyMall when it goes up for auction, we have to be prepared for a world without the tray table nap pillow or those giant yard yetis, as James Bingham remembers.</p>
    <p>JAMES BINGHAM: You always dreamed, like, someday maybe you'd make it big enough to be able to afford those.</p>
    <p>HU: Anne Lewis of Pierre, South Dakota recalls SkyMall as a link to home.</p>
    <p>ANNE LEWIS: In the early '90s, we lived overseas. And my mother bought us a huge AM/FM shortwave radio from SkyMall so we could listen to Voice of America.</p>
    <p>HU: Matthew Bagot of Baton Rouge says it's a link to his mom.</p>
    <p>MATTHEW BAGOT: Every flight she took, every business trip she took, she'd bring back a copy for me. And I could always expect that when I got home.</p>
    <p>HU: Danielle St. Louis of Madison, Wisconsin uses SkyMall like so many of the rest of us.</p>
    <p>DANIELLE ST. LOUIS: It's kind of, like, the thing I look forward to when I get on the plane - is I'm going to get to sort of faux shop through SkyMall.</p>
    <p>HU: And Ehren Werner of Santa Rosa reads it to the end.</p>
    <p>EHREN WERNER: The very last page of the SkyMall I picked up had a personal submarine/watercraft called the Sea Breacher for the low, low price of only $85,000.</p>
    <p>HU: Maybe that's why its parent company is filing for bankruptcy - too few submarine sales. Elise Hu, NPR News.</p>
