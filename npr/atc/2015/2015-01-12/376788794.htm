<h1> "At CES, A Gadget To Fix Everything \u2014 Except Relationships" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>And a final thought on tech now from last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Commentator Judy Carter was there checking out gizmos with human relationships on her mind.</p>
    <p>JUDY CARTER, BYLINE: I was supposed to go to the show with my partner, but we had a fight. So I went alone, wondering if gadgets could help us. The first thing I see - a brain-sensing headband.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: But what it does is it senses the electronic signals coming from your brain.</p>
    <p>CARTER: Can it sense the brain activity of your husband or your wife?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: No and it doesn't necessarily read your brain. It just reads your brain activity.</p>
    <p>CARTER: Oh, well. I moved across the floor.</p>
    <p>This is SoulMate Technology?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Yes.</p>
    <p>CARTER: They were just selling chargers for mobile phones.</p>
    <p>I thought it was finding your soulmate, like dating, like getting married. No?</p>
    <p>There are thousands of gadgets to recharge phones but nothing to recharge relationships. Apparently, the most important relationship you have is with yourself. I don't need anybody as long as I have my own drone.</p>
    <p>What does this say?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Taking your selfies to new heights. You throw your Zano up, and you get a photo or a video of you in a location.</p>
    <p>CARTER: So you can take selfies of yourself now from the sky?</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Yes, pretty much.</p>
    <p>CARTER: Probably a little more flattering.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Yeah.</p>
    <p>CARTER: The theme of CES - people don't need people, they did gadgets. Well, as I'm leaving, I look up and I see a big sign proclaiming the message of this conference - break free of your attachments. Really? But I need attachments. Coming home, I realized that my partner does something that no gadget does - makes me laugh. But hey, coming in 2016 - the new gadget Laugh At That for all platforms - uh oh.
