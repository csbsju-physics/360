<h1> "On His 80th Birthday, Shake It Like Elvis With A Milkshake" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>An American icon was born 80 years ago today.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ALL SHOOK UP")</p>
    <p>ELVIS PRESLEY: (Singing) Well, bless my soul. What's wrong with me? I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: We're going to mark the birthday of Elvis Aaron Presley with two of his favorite things, music and food. It's a Found Recipes story about the Elvis Presley milkshake.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>SEAN BROCK: It's peanut butter, banana, some cooked, crispy bacon. And we also used bacon fat and ice cream.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Wait. Did he say bacon and bacon fat? Oh, yes, he did. Sean Brock is the owner of the restaurants Husk and McCrady's in Charleston, South Carolina. A couple of years ago, he told us how he created this milkshake tribute to the King.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ALL SHOOK UP")</p>
    <p>PRESLEY: (Singing) My heart beats so it scares me to death.</p>
    <p>BROCK: I am a really big Elvis fan. One of his favorite things to eat was a peanut butter and banana sandwich that he would often fry in bacon fat or, like, tons and tons of butter.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MILKCOW BLUES BOOGIE")</p>
    <p>PRESLEY: (Singing) Well I woke up this morning, and I looked out the door. I can tell that old milk cow. I can tell...</p>
    <p>BROCK: One day - it was right around Elvis's birthday - and I just wanted to do something unique and fun and immediately thought of those flavors.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MILKCOW BLUES BOOGIE")</p>
    <p>PRESLEY: (Singing) I ain't had milk and butter since that cow's been gone.</p>
    <p>BROCK: So two very ripe bananas, vanilla ice cream, just straight peanut butter, some bacon that has been cooked crispy. And there's also a little bacon fat. You want the bacon fat to be cold and solid. The bourbon is really my touch. A lot of people don't know that Elvis actually didn't drink. It's just something we add in the there for our own personal amusement.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MILKCOW BLUES BOOGIE")</p>
    <p>PRESLEY: (Singing) Ah, let's milk it.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF BLENDER)</p>
    <p>BROCK: I don't even want to know what the calorie count is going to be.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF BLENDER)</p>
    <p>BROCK: There you go, the Elvis Presley milkshake. And it has, like, chunks of bacon in it - so good. It's, like, all my favorite things. (Laughter).</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LAWDY MISS CLAWD")</p>
    <p>PRESLEY: (Singing) Well...</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Sean Brock is a chef based in Charleston, South Carolina. Details on how to make his Elvis Presley milkshake are on our Found Recipes page at npr.org.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>And lest you think we're not calorie conscious, we calculated, made a rough estimate of the calories in that shake. With the bacon, peanut butter, bourbon, ice cream and bananas, it's just under 2,400.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: And worth every one.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DEVIL IN DISGUISE")</p>
    <p>PRESLEY: (Singing) You're the devil in disguise. Oh, yes, you are. Devil in disguise...</p>
