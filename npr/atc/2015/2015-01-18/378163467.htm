<h1> "A Tattooist And A Tweet Take A Band From Tiny Clubs To Tours" </h1>
    <p>ARUN RATH, HOST: </p>
    <p>You're tuned to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. It's been a year now since we started our series My Big Break, bringing you stories of career-changing moments big and small. The LA-based band Fitz and the Tantrums has been called a genre-smashing group, blending retro soul and R&B with indie pop. In the six years since the band formed, they've had two singles at the top of Billboard's Alternative Songs chart and one that's cracked the Hot 100. Fitz the Tantrums got their start in 2008. Vocalist Noelle Scaggs was invited to sing at a rehearsal organized by the band's founder, Michael "Fitz" Fitzpatrick.</p>
    <p>MICHAEL FITZPATRICK: That was the crazy thing - is that this collective of six people had never played together as one unit before. And we played that first song, "Breaking The Chains Of Love."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BREAKING THE CHAINS OF LOVE")</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: From the first time we played it, it sounded like we had been playing together for years.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BREAKING THE CHAINS OF LOVE")</p>
    <p>FITZ AND THE TANTRUMS: (Singing) I said, oh, what a lovely day. Breaking the chains of love. I'm hoping that you won't find a new love.</p>
    <p>NOELLE SCAGGS: Our voices worked. You know, it really worked immediately. And I think, after that first song, we kind of looked at each other - all of those nerves all kind of went away.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BREAKING THE CHAINS OF LOVE")</p>
    <p>FITZ AND THE TANTRUMS: (Singing) Oh, can't you see, can't you see that you're mine? 'Cause I know that, baby, you're mine.</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: And that first song and that first rehearsal was so magical that I walked out of the room. I called the Hotel Cafe, which is this famous singer-songwriter place in LA, and came in the room and told everybody, we got a show next week. And everyone's like, um, we don't even have enough songs. And I go, well, we better get cracking. The week after that, we did our first show in front of 50 of our closest friends. And it was crazy. Like, we were such a young band. We had literally done, I think, six or seven shows, and we had actually done a performance on the LA-based KCRW station.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF KCRW BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED RADIO HOST: Fitz and the Tantrums live on KCRW - great way to wrap up our workweek, you guys are blowing up the spot.</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: Well, thank you. Thank you.</p>
    <p>SCAGGS: Thank you.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED RADIO HOST: Sounds terrific.</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: And there was this tattoo artist visiting from New York. He heard us on the radio, flipped out, bought our little EP that we had done in my living room, put up by ourselves on the inter-webs, and went back to New York.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MAROON 5 SONG, "THIS LOVE")</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: Adam Levine from Maroon 5 was in New York, and that's his favorite tattoo artist. He goes to visit him for some work to be done on his sleeves, and he walks and the guy says, you got to here this new band, Fitz and the Tantrums. It's blowing my mind. I love it. Check it out. And so Adam proceeds to listen, starts tweeting about our music. We start having a little conversation with him via Twitter.</p>
    <p>SCAGGS: Actually, I think I remember the tweeting situation with Adam Levine saying, you know, this band Fitz and the Tantrums is, like, my new thing. And I was, like, is this a drone? (Laughter) I was, like - or no, what do they call it?</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: A bot. A bot.</p>
    <p>SCAGGS: A robot or a bot or something? I was, like, you know, is this his real Twitter account, you know?</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: And it was actually him.</p>
    <p>SCAGGS: It was actually him.</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: A week later, he was sitting front row at this tiny little club show that we were doing. And a week after that, we got an offer to open up for Maroon 5 on their big East Coast college tour.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE WALKER")</p>
    <p>SCAGGS: I think maybe Adam Levine heard that there was something really for thinking about the approach that we were going for.</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: And that was just this crazy, serendipitous moment - one of many that propelled this band forward. And we kind of have never stopped since then.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE WALKER")</p>
    <p>FITZ AND THE TANTRUMS: (Singing) Oh, here we go, feel it in my soul, really need it, need it so good. Got to feel it. Oh, it takes control. Really need it, need it.</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: All of us have been in many different projects. There was just a different energy that came out of this from the get-go. Like, the universe was aligning. And that said, there was also an incredible amount of back-breaking work. Our success was kind of like success by a thousand paper cuts. You know it was just little by little by little by little.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MORE THAN JUST A DREAM")</p>
    <p>FITZ AND THE TANTRUMS: (Singing) More than just a dream.</p>
    <p>FITZPATRICK: I still, every show, peak out behind the curtain, and I'm surprised that anyone's there to see us.</p>
    <p>SCAGGS: We feel blessed every day that we get to do what we do. That's the break.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MORE THAN JUST A DREAM")</p>
