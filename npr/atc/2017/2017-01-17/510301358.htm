<h1> "4-Year-Old Girl Reads More Than 1,000 Books" </h1>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>In one year, a typical American will read about four books. For more serious readers, it's more like 50 or a hundred. Daliyah Arana has read more than a thousand books in the past couple of years. That is 1,000. And Daliyah is 4 years old. All that reading got her a trip to the Library of Congress where she was named honorary librarian for the day last week.</p>
    <p>Daliyah Arana and her mom, Haleema, are with us now from Gainesville, Ga., where they live. Hello to both of you.</p>
    <p>HALEEMA ARANA: Hello.</p>
    <p>DALIYAH ARANA: Hello.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: What was it like to be at the Library of Congress?</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: I had so much fun.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Yeah.</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: Uh-huh.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Haleema, when did you start reading to Daliyah, and when did she take over the reading job?</p>
    <p>ARANA: I started reading to her immediately after she was born. I would pretty much hold her, and she would hear stories as I was reading to my two older children. And she was actually memorizing a lot of the words that she would see in the books. And it was at one point where she wanted to take the book and say, I want to do this now. And it took off from there.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Most kids don't learn to read till 4 or 5, even 6. You must have been aware, like, wow, she's really getting started early.</p>
    <p>ARANA: It's actually something that I did with all three of my children. But with her, I just - I took it to the next level just because of her passion for it and her love for it so much.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Daliyah, was it your idea to read a thousand books?</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: No, it was mommy's idea.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Did you think, boy, that's going to be hard, or did you think, that'll be easy?</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: That was easy 'cause I love to read.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: So Haleema, it was your idea to read a thousand books. Where did you get the idea?</p>
    <p>ARANA: Actually I read about - there was an article in a local newspaper about a young girl who had just finished the program, and that's where I actually got the idea. Hey, you know, Daliyah - she's already reading a lot. This is a great way for me to start counting.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: But wasn't that program about the number of books parents should be reading to kids, right? And you took it a step further.</p>
    <p>ARANA: Right, I did, and she actually enjoyed it because every time she completed a log of 50 books, she would return that to the library, and she would get a small prize. And that's what kind of kept her motivated as well.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Oh, neat. Daliyah, can you hear me?</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: Hello.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Hi. Do you remember the first book you ever read?</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: "Ann's Big Muffin."</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: "Ann's Big Muffin."</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: Yeah.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: What's your favorite book right now?</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: My favorite book is "The Pigeon Finds A Hot Dog!"</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: "The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog!" - I love the "Pigeon" books. What happens in that book?</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: Well, it's about a duckling and the Pigeon. They fight over the hot dog. And the duckling splits it in half at the ending.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: And they share it.</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: And they share.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Daliyah Arana, thank you so much.</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: You're welcome.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: And Haleema Arana, thank you, too.</p>
    <p>ARANA: Thank you.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Daliyah Arana was librarian for the day at the Library of Congress last week. Here she is reading her favorite book.</p>
    <p>DALIYAH: "The Pigeon Finds A Hot Dog!" - words and pictures by Mo Willems. Oh, a hot dog - yummy, yummy, yummy. Oh, may I help you? Is that a hot dog - not a hot dog, my hot dog. Oh, I don't think...</p>
