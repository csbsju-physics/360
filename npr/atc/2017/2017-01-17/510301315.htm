<h1> "Obamas Pay Final Visit To Swing Set They Donated To D.C. Shelter" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>The peaceful transition of power from Obama to Trump apparently does not include swing sets. Malia and Sasha's castle, a large wooden playground structure complete with a slide, rope ladder and swings, was a fixture outside the Oval Office for the past eight years.</p>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>The playset is now a fixture at a Washington, D.C., shelter for needy families. Yesterday the president and first lady had one more chance to play.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: What's going on, guys? How you doing?</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: The Obamas visited the Jobs Have Priority Naylor Road Program, the structure's new home.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: The castle was built in 2009 for the two Obama daughters. It gave the president a chance to watch his children play while he worked. The outgoing Obamas offered the playset to the incoming Trumps, but the Trumps declined.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And while Sasha and Malia are way past playground age these days, the president had no problem jumping back into his role as swing teacher in chief.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>OBAMA: Keep your legs - pull your legs up. When you go out, you pull your legs up. (Inaudible) There you go. That's the move right here.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: One more wistful moment for the Obamas in a week and month full of them.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>OBAMA: I know. It brings back memories.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Don't forget the other one.</p>
    <p>OBAMA: Don't worry. She's got it. She's got it. She's got good momentum.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Pump those legs, girl.</p>
    <p>OBAMA: Pump those legs.</p>
