<h1> "Apple's iPhone Turns 10 Years Old" </h1>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>Now let's note an anniversary.</p>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>To do that, imagine a world where no one is bent over a little glowing screen.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Or where confronted with a question at a dinner party, no one Googles the answer right at the table.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Or where you can go on a hike and not see a person taking a selfie.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: That was the world that existed 10 years ago, before this man introduced, as he said, three new things.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>STEVE JOBS: A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: That, of course, is the late Steve Jobs, who was then the head of Apple.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>JOBS: These are not three separate devices.</p>
    <p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>JOBS: This is one device...</p>
    <p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>JOBS: ...And we are calling it iPhone.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: IPhone, unveiled on January 9, 2007.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Steven Levy was in that audience. He's now editor of the tech publication Backchannel. He says back then, there were cell phones, even smartphones, but not like the iPhone.</p>
    <p>STEVEN LEVY: Smartphones, at the time, weren't really all that smart.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: He says they couldn't smoothly browse the web, play music easily or edit photos very well.</p>
    <p>LEVY: It was a challenge to really get things done besides making phone calls on these other phones that called themselves smart.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: After Jobs' famous speech, Levy went backstage to talk to the Apple CEO.</p>
    <p>LEVY: I said, why did you do a phone? And he said, well, we did a lot of market research and, you know, talked to all the analysts and buying people and decided we can make a lot of money. And then he laughed (laughter) and he said, no, totally that's not us. And, of course, that's not the way Apple operates at all.</p>
    <p>They do what they think is the right thing to do and assume people will follow.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: And people did follow. Other companies followed, too. Today it would be hard to find a smartphone that doesn't have a touch screen. Steven Levy got his first iPhone shortly after hearing Jobs' talk. He's upgraded since. He still likes the iPhone but says there's a downside to the technology.</p>
    <p>LEVY: We are now cyborgs. We can't exist without these things. We're very dependent on them. It's like a limb. And it's a little odd to be out there where you're a very strong person with your mobile smart device but you're weaker without it.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Steven Levy of Backchannel. The iPhone was introduced 10 years ago today.</p>
