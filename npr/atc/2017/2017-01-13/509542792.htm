<h1> "Last Call: Send Us Your Commercials For 'Nicer Living' Project" </h1>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>And now it's time for a last call on the Commercials for Nicer Living project, version 2017.</p>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>This is an update of a project that Susan Stamberg ran 45 years ago on this program. She asked listeners to write commercials for life's little joys.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: And five of those were turned into commercials for Nicer Living with music and sound effects.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: There were ads for love letters, clouds, waiting, walking and the bio-clock.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Also known as your built in time piece.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Bio-clock is the result of eons of research and development. By Flora and Fauna Laboratories, bio-clock costs you nothing. You already own it...</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Oh, yeah, that is definitely from 1972.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: (Laughter) Yeah, we wanted to know what things make your life nicer today, in 2017, so we launched a new Commercials for a Nicer Living project. And so far we've gotten more than a thousand ideas.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Peter Manos in Seattle sent in the most. He wrote ads for peace and quiet, cats, snowmen, belly laughs, Joshua trees...</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And breathing through your nose.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: (Laughter) A simple pleasure that eludes many of us this time of year.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: OK, here's where the last call comes in. You have just a few more days to join our Commercials for Nicer Living, version 2017. The address is npr.org/nicer.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: You only need to write a script - no more than 120 words. We'll pick five to produce like actual radio commercials and share them on air in a couple of weeks.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: The deadline is this Sunday, January 15.</p>
