<h1> "Trump Acknowledges Russian Cyber-Mischief In News Conference" </h1>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called the media dishonest, held a wide-ranging news conference today, the first since being elected president. It was also the first time we heard Trump himself acknowledge Russia's meddling in the U.S. election.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>DONALD TRUMP: As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.</p>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>Trump did leave the door open for a better relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>TRUMP: If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That's called an asset, not a liability.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: In addition, Trump said he never acted in a way that would have left him vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. We'll have more on that in a moment.</p>
