    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>Need a distraction from the news?</p>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>We have one.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: It's a reminder of the good things in life that are free.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Another commercial for Nicer Living.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I used to worry about what I was breathing in - oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide. And then I discovered trees.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Tree.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Whispering) Trees.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Whispering) Trees.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Yes. Natural trees with their photosynthetic respiration helping to produce just the right blend of the breathable atmosphere that our bodies need.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Trees.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Whispering) Trees.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Whispering) Trees.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Whispering) Trees.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Trees may not be right for everybody. Side effects include tree houses, tire swings, fruit, shade and woodworking. Please consult your biome before selecting a tree. Not every tree is right for every biome. Enjoy trees responsibly.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: All natural, safe and effective trees - now with chlorophyll, available on a planet under you.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: And that radio ad was written by Adam Drake of Broken Arrow, Okla., one of the thousands - literally, thousands of suggestions that you all sent in.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: And one of the five we selected...</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: For our commercials for a Nicer Living project.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: We'll hear two others later this week.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF DELICATE STEVE SONG, "BALLAD OF SPECK AND PEBBLE")</p>
