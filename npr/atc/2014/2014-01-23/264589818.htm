<h1> "From Down Under, A Paprikash To Warm You All Over" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>Today's Found Recipe is perfect for a cold winter day. It's spicy. It's meaty. It's a real belly warmer. But we start with a scene from a real heart warmer, the romantic comedy "When Harry Met Sally.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "WHEN HARRY MET SALLY")</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: No, not that scene. No.</p>

    <p>MERELYN CHALMERS: A paprikash is essentially a casserole, a Hungarian casserole.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: That's Merelyn Chalmers. There's never too much pepper in her paprikash - only about a fourth a teaspoon, in fact. Chalmers is one of the women behind Australia's Monday Morning Cooking Club, a group dedicated to collecting recipes from the best home cooks in Sydney's Jewish community. Their cookbook includes a recipe for Mum's Rice Paprikash. Mum being Merelyn Chalmer's late mother, a woman who survived Auschwitz.</p>
    <p>CHALMERS: My mum was Hungarian and we ate paprikash probably five nights a week. This was something that she just threw together when I wasn't feeling well or my brother. And I moved to Sydney many years later thinking that this was a nothing dish that my mother threw together in a pressure cooker. And I realized that there were all these daughters of Hungarian women in Sydney. We have quite a large Hungarian-Jewish population, and they had all grown up on the same dish.</p>
    <p>I make it a couple of times a winter. You can do it with veal or beef or chicken. You fry off onions till they're very, very dark golden brown. You sear the meat till it's a very dark golden. Then you add in a little bit of fresh capsicum, as we call it in Australia - that's pepper, red pepper in America. And then you put in some beautiful, good quality Hungarian paprika spice.</p>
    <p>My mother would then put in a touch of garlic and a little bit of carrot to get some extra sweetness, only a little bit. You cook it slowly like a casserole.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>CHALMERS: For me personally, it's like mother's milk. It is tenderness emotionally, as well as tenderness in the bite of the meat. And it really minds me of my mum.</p>
