<h1> "SpaceX Could Give Struggling Texas City A Boost" </h1>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>SpaceX has its eye on Texas. The space company would like to build a commercial orbital launch site at a remote spot on the state's southern tip. The prospect of a space port has stirred quite a buzz in the border city of Brownsville. As NPR's John Burnett reports, locals wonder if this depressed area will be home to the world's newest aerospace hub.</p>
    <p>JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: This really is the end of the road. Texas Highway 4 abruptly ends at the warm waves of the Gulf surrounded by cactus, Spanish dagger and sand dunes.</p>
    <p>GILBERTO SALINAS: Welcome to Boca Chica beach, Brownsville, Texas. It's where the United States really begins.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: Or ends, depending on your perspective. This is Gil Salinas, executive vice president of the Brownsville Economic Development Council. He's spent three years toiling to get SpaceX to build its first launch facility out here, which would include a hangar, fuel storage, payload processing facility, and launch control center.</p>
    <p>SALINAS: Right there you would have the actual launchpad itself where the rocket would - they would erect it and then off into space it goes.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: SpaceX has been sending up its rockets at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Cape Canaveral in Florida.</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Four, three, two, one, zero.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: Now they want a place to call their own, and it turns out that this lonely patch of coastal prairie only three miles north of Mexico is a sweet spot for orbital spacecraft launches. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk told South by Southwest in Austin last year that Texas is his leading candidate.</p>
    <p>ELON MUSK: It makes sense to have a commercial space port. We need to be able to launch eastward, and we want to be close to the equator.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: Eager to make the deal work, Texas has offered SpaceX a $15 million incentive package, and passed a special law that would close the public beach during launches. The FAA is now in its final fact-finding and public-comment phase to decide whether or not to grant a launch license to Space Exploration Technologies Corp, the formal name for SpaceX.</p>
    <p>Other federal agencies have weighed in. The National Park Service is concerned that rocket launches will disturb the view of nearby Palmito Ranch Battlefield, the site of the last land battle of the Civil War. And the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has a wildlife refuge on the fence line of the proposed launch site.</p>
    <p>Spokesperson Lesli Gray says the tidal flats, thorn scrub and adjacent Gulf waters are home to 10 endangered species.</p>
    <p>LESLI GRAY: Including the ocelot and the aplomado falcon and Kemp's Ridley sea turtle. We obviously are looking at what the potential impacts are, and we've been working with SpaceX to minimize any impact from the SpaceX facility being there.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: Fish & Wildlife is concerned that increased noise, traffic, light, storm water runoff will disturb the wild things in the neighborhood. But it concludes SpaceX is "not likely to threaten their continued existence." Other curious species down here that will be affected by the nighttime launches can speak for themselves.</p>
    <p>JIM WORKMAN: We liked it down here, but now it's going to be a lot busier, a lot more loud, a lot more, you know, congestion. I guess it's something that Texas wants and Brownsville wants, so we'll have to go along with it.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: Jim Workman is a winter Texan who lives in a village across the road from the SpaceX site. He's a retired truck driver from Minnesota who escapes subzero weather every year here in his little brick house in balmy Bock Chica. His neighbor, Ed Schumann, is also a retired Minnesota trucker and has a different opinion.</p>
    <p>ED SCHUMANN: I like rockets. I watch them on TV when they shoot off and go to the moon and wherever. That'd be fine with me, I mean, I got nothing against that. That's good.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: The lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas is known for sprawling citrus orchards, car parts factories across the river in Mexico, and farmworkers living in substandard housing. SpaceX could represent hundreds of good-paying full- and part-time jobs. Again, local business booster Gil Salinas.</p>
    <p>SALINAS: A project of this magnitude and of this significance is a game changer for - especially for a region like ours. Brownsville, Texas, is one of the poorest regions in the United States.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: The SpaceX project has raised hopes for young people like Louis Dartez, a 22-year-old physics grad student at the University of Texas, Brownsville. Dartez says growing up in the tip of Texas, ambitious students like him learn a hard lesson.</p>
    <p>LOUIS DARTEZ: And that's quite simply put as get the heck out of Brownsville. Whatever you do, if you don't leave the first time an opportunity presents itself, you never will. All of this and much more could change with SpaceX having a presence down here.</p>
    <p>BURNETT: Louis Dartez, for one, has already submitted his resume to SpaceX. The FAA's final decision on the company's proposed launch site is expected later this year. John Burnett, NPR News.</p>
