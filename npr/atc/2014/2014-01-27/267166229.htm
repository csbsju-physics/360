<h1> "You've Got Mail, And It Smells Like 18th Century Paris" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>Remember Scratch N' Sniff, paper you can smell? Or Smell-O-Vision, a technology that didn't quite catch on that was supposed to bring smell to movie audiences.</p>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>Or what about the Smell Master 3000 from the 1994 movie "Richie Rich"?</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "RICHIE RICH")</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Well, now a company in Paris has developed a mobile phone that sends aromatic text messages. It's called the oPhone, O for olfactory. And the mastermind behind it...</p>
    <p>DAVID EDWARDS: David Edwards. I'm the founder of the Laboretoire in Paris, and I'm a professor at the University of Harvard.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: He and his students thought up a way to transmit all kinds of smells.</p>
    <p>EDWARDS: Aromas that range from bread and flowers to the smell of Paris 300 years ago.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: The aromas are pre-programmed into the oPhone. Type a message and you can attach a smell that you think relates. Someone with an oPhone on the receiving end will get a whiff.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Why do this? Well, David Edwards says communication is just missing something without a smell.</p>
    <p>EDWARDS: Clearly, a big difference between me saying to you the word croissant or even showing you a picture of a croissant and you smelling a croissant.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Edwards says oPhones will be for sale later this year although you can't record your own smells yet.</p>
    <p>EDWARDS: However, being able to transmit the aroma of what I'm experiencing through a kind of a camera is imaginable, and so I think that will be coming for sure.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: And he's working with businesses like coffee shops to make the oPhone part of the consumer experience.</p>
