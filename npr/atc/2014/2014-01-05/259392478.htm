<h1> "In High-Drama Parody, Will Ferrell Reveals 'Spoils Of Babylon'" </h1>
    <p>ARUN RATH, HOST: </p>
    <p>We'll take a look back now at a best-selling book from the '70s, one you might not remember: "The Spoils of Babylon," by Eric Jonrosh, the epic tale of the powerful yet scandalous Morehouse family. It was made into a television miniseries that never saw the light of day - until now.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SPOILS OF BABYLON")</p>
    <p>TOBEY MAGUIRE: (As Devon Morehouse) My name is Devon Morehouse. Yes, that Devon Morehouse. But I didn't start out with that name.</p>
    <p>RATH: Actually, everything about "The Spoils of Babylon," even the writer, is fake. It's a parody of the big, bloated miniseries of a few decades back, like "The Thorn Birds" or "The Winds of War." The series begins this Thursday on IFC; and it stars Tobey Maguire and Kristen Wiig. Will Ferrell appears as the author Eric Jonrosh, and as the Shah of Iran.</p>
    <p>The director of "The Spoils of Babylon" is Matt Piedmont. He was a writer on "Saturday Night Live," and he's worked with Will Ferrell's Funny or Die production team to bring this tale to the small screen. I asked Piedmont for the Hollywood pitch version of the story, which begins in the late 1930s. Actor Tim Robbins plays the family's patriarch.</p>
    <p>MATT PIEDMONT: Jonas Morehouse - Jonas has gone to Texas from New York, to strike out as an oil wildcatter.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SPOILS OF BABYLON")</p>
    <p>TIM ROBBINS: (As Jonas Morehouse) You see these hands? This nation was built by hands like these; honest hands, mostly African and Chinese, laboring under the belief that hard work is a religion onto itself.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Along the way they pick up Devon Morehouse - becomes a Morehouse. They adopt him.</p>
    <p>RATH: Literally - pick him up by the side of the road.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: They do, pick him up by the side of the road. This is 1938 now.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SPOILS OF BABYLON")</p>
    <p>ROBBINS: (As Jonas Morehouse) You can decide on what you want to call yourself in due time - Hezekiah, Ezekiel, Steve, Jim Bob, Skippy, Jesus, Jerry, Vladimir, Ortencio, Mahurishi, Billy...</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: They end up actually striking oil and becoming rich - very wealthy family. Devon Morehouse - played by Tobey Maguire - and Cynthia Morehouse - played by Kristen Wiig - fall in love. But it's a forbidden love as they are, you know, technically now brother and sister, although not by blood.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SPOILS OF BABYLON")</p>
    <p>KRISTEN WIIG: (As Cynthia Morehouse) What?</p>
    <p>MAGUIRE: (As Devon Morehouse) Oh, no.</p>
    <p>WIIG: (As Cynthia Morehouse) Why not?</p>
    <p>MAGUIRE: (As Devon Morehouse) I'm getting my coat. I don't want to do this.</p>
    <p>WIIG: (As Cynthia Morehouse) Why not?</p>
    <p>MAGUIRE: (As Devon Morehouse) I do want to do...</p>
    <p>WIIG: (As Cynthia Morehouse) You do.</p>
    <p>MAGUIRE: (As Devon Morehouse) I do. You're right. No, I can't do this. I can't...</p>
    <p>WIIG: (As Cynthia Morehouse) OK, fine.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Devon goes off to war, comes back with a new bride. I won't spoil who the new bride is - voiced by Cary Mulligan, though, a very talented actress.</p>
    <p>RATH: The fact that she has to be voiced gives a little bit away.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Yeah. I know. Exactly. But I'll just leave it at that. And then Devon goes his own way, becomes kind of a beat poet, kind of goes the green way. And Cynthia ends up taking over the company, and becomes a little bit more like a traditional president of an oil company. They're trying to avoid their love for each other, which is very difficult. I know it's kind of vague. I'm not very good about dishing plot but that's, essentially, the gist of it.</p>
    <p>RATH: It's sort of like "The Winds of War" or "North South"...</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Yes.</p>
    <p>RATH: ...the family history intertwined with the telling of America.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Yes, exactly. Thank you. See? Why didn't I just have you do it in the first place? You should've - yeah, great. Exactly.</p>
    <p>RATH: And the lead characters age pretty well over the course of...</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Yeah, yeah. They - well, they use a lot of special creams and things, so their skin stays very nice and moist. But, yeah - no, they age over about a 50-year period so...</p>
    <p>RATH: Well, you do a lot of playing with time, because not only the work itself spans decades and decades, but the film - the fake film, which we're now seeing here for the first time, was made in 1979.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: (Laughter) Yeah. There's a lot of weird meta-stuff going on, where Will Ferrell is a nonexistent author of a nonexistent best seller, who introduces this. And then the film was essentially a miniseries that was shot for three years - from between 1976 and 1979 - but never released. It's kind of like Ambersons - when Orson Welles made "Magnificent Ambersons," and I cut that out and then they've released it. So this was never released, supposedly, and then they now are just - he needs the money, so they're doing a truncated version now.</p>
    <p>RATH: Well, you mention Orson Welles. And there's a really Orson Welles-y kind of feel to the character - the author character of Jonrosh, played by Will Ferrell.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SPOILS OF BABYLON")</p>
    <p>WILL FERRELL: (As Eric Jonrosh) Please, won't you enjoy Part 2 of my wonderful miniseries, "The Spoils of Babylon."</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: You know, it made us laugh, the '70s kind of Orson Welles who, you know, had kind of fallen from grace, who's...</p>
    <p>RATH: Did a lot of commercials.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Paul Masson winery commercial. You've seen some of those where maybe he's a little intoxicated, actually, on air</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SPOILS OF BABYLON")</p>
    <p>FERRELL: (As Eric Jonrosh) Why would I say wonderful? No one says wonderful. Sounds like something a man from the - a circus would say.</p>
    <p>RATH: And the bitterness kind of comes through.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Yeah. I think what we liked is that he's bitter. If you see Orson Welles in the '70s, he still likes to hear himself talk. He may be bitter, he may - that may come through pretty obviously. But you can tell he's - once he starts getting warmed up, he likes the tales he's spinning.</p>
    <p>And so we kind of wanted to combine that in the character that we created for Will, and have him to have some fun. Will - you know, there's no one better than Will Ferrell doing that kind of stuff. So I think we came up with something that he had a lot of fun doing.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SPOILS OF BABYLON")</p>
    <p>FERRELL: (As Eric Jonrosh) After a painful ordeal to bring my popular novels to television, I gave up. I could see that the network executives cared little for art, so I filmed "The Spoils of Babylon" on my own. I lived and breathed "Spoils" for three years. I slept with the cast. Every member of the cast you'll see tonight, I slept with. My wife at the time...</p>
    <p>RATH: You have this reputation going back to your days as a "Saturday Night Live" writer, for writing stuff that's just brilliant but just so out there that it couldn't - do you have more latitude with Funny or Die to - when you're pitching stuff like this directly to Will Farrell?</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Well, it's...</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: No, the problem is I think this is all normal. So maybe that says more about me, when people say it's out there. To me, I'm pitching a normal idea. You know, I never really think of boundaries or thinking of, is this too much or - you know, it's almost like, if it's too much, let's go even further. And it seems to have worked out OK so far. But...</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>RATH: Matt Piedmont is the writer, director behind the fake "Spoils of Babylon" which will be premiering - first episode this Thursday, Jan. 9, on IFC. Matt, thank you.</p>
    <p>PIEDMONT: Thank you very much.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: Misty visions cloud my mind. All I've had, I've left behind. Like a stranger, I walk alone...</p>
