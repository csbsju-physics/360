<h1> "Beyonce's National Anthem: Did She Sync Or Didn't She?" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>Well, it didn't take long. We learned today that one of the performances at yesterday's inauguration ceremony was not as it seemed. Beyonce lip-synced her rendition of "The National Anthem," that's according to a spokesman for the U.S. Marine Band, which played live over Beyonce prerecorded track.</p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>The spokesman said today it is standard practice for inaugural music to be prerecorded in case weather gets in the way. At the 2009 inaugural, an all-star quartet, including cellist Yo-Yo Ma, famously faked their performance because of the frigid and windy weather.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Well, Beyonce chose not to risk it yesterday. Other performers did. A representative for Kelly Clarkson, who sang "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" after President Obama's speech, told the Associated Press that Clarkson sang her part live, cold and all.</p>
