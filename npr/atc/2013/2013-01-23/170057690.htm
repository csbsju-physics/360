<h1> "Burning Cheese Closes Norwegian Road For Days" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>Norwegian TV probably said it best in their first reports from the seen of last week's goat cheese fire in a road tunnel in the Arctic.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF NEWS CLIP)</p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>That's right, a goat cheese fire. Call it the fondue heard round the world. The incident - and, Robert, it's the first of its kind in anyone's memory - occurred late last week near the city of Narvik. Twenty tons of brown cheese were on a truck when it ignited. It took four days to extinguish the blaze. Fortunately, no one was hurt but the road tunnel remains closed and will be for about a week. So far, no official word yet on what started the fire burning.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: So, what is this combustible brown cheese, we wondered? Are we safe? Does the U.N. know about this?</p>
    <p>ROLLEIV SOLHOLM: Well, we call in Brunost.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: That's Rolleiv Solholm, chief editor of the Norway Post in Oslo.</p>
    <p>SOLHOLM: It's very unusual. I can't remember myself having heard ever that a load of brown cheese was caught fire in a tunnel.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Brunost is unique to Norway, Solholm says. And creating the product requires several steps.</p>
    <p>SOLHOLM: It is made by boiling over a long time cow's milk or goat's milk. And then it becomes more or less like a caramel substance. And it is then poured into containers that makes it usually a square block, like a brick.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Solholm says the brown cheese is a hit with tourists, who usually leave Norway with one of those bricks. It's served on rye crisp or bread, and sold around the world in gourmet cheese stores.</p>
    <p>As to the cheese as a flammable substance...</p>
    <p>SOLHOLM: Of course the thing that makes it burn for so long is the fact that it is a sugar-caramel substance, which of course would just keep on burning for days, you know.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: A spokesman for the Norwegian Public Roads Administration says that in his 15 years in the department, this incident was the first cheese-related fire to close a road. He says he didn't know cheese burned so well.</p>
