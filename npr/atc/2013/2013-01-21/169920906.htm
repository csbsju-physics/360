<h1> "Senators' Tussle Over Pens Breaks Inauguration's Decorum" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>Finally, after today's inaugural activities, there was a brief tussle over a basic piece of technology: a pen. President Obama sat down at a desk to sign some official documents using an official-looking set of pens.</p>
    <p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: He was flanked by leaders of the House and Senate.</p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: </p>
    <p>And just as the president finished and got up to leave, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid leaned in and grabbed a pen.</p>
    <p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: No, no, no, Harry. Harry.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: That's Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer scolding his majority leader. Reid put the pen back.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: As you may recall, pens that are used to sign major legislation are sometimes handed out as souvenirs, but this was not apparently one of those times.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Then the president stepped in.</p>
    <p>PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I can get you one, man.</p>
    <p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
    <p>OBAMA: I'm going to get you - this is a nice one.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: Obama reached inside his jacket pocket and handed a pen to Senator Reid, a little piece of history from Inauguration Day 2013.</p>
