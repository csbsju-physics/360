<h1> "What Gaza Means For Obama Policy" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, Host: </p>
    <p>More Israeli air strikes in Gaza today, and more Hamas rockets fired into southern Israel. And the diplomatic back and forth continues. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met today with Arab and Israeli leaders at the United Nations. She said the U.S. supports a cease-fire proposal offered by Egypt and France. Of course, Secretary Rice's days in her job are numbered. Senior news analyst Daniel Schorr has some thoughts on what the conflict means for the next U.S. administration.</p>
    <p>DANIEL SCHORR: Mr. Obama would surely prefer to put the Middle East situation on a back burner while he wrestles with the economic crisis. But events may not permit him to. And so the 44th president will become the latest to try to deal with the oldest established conflict in the world. This is Daniel Schorr.</p>
