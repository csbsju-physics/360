<h1> "Joe The Plumber Trades Wrench For Press Pass" </h1>
    <p>: Joe the Plumber. Yup, the man made briefly famous during the presidential elections, Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, will cover the Gaza conflict from Israel. He told Toledo's NBC affiliate, WNWO, that he'll be talking to average Israelis.</p>
    <p>: I'd like to go over there and let their average Joes share their story - what they think, how they feel - especially with, you know, world opinion, maybe get a real story out there.</p>
    <p>: Wurzelbacher says he'll be in Israel for 10 days.</p>
