<h1> "A Call For Inauguration Attendees" </h1>
    <p>GUY RAZ, host: </p>
    <p>Welcome back to All Things Considered from NPR News. I'm Guy Raz, and I'm outside the Hay-Adams Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., the home for the moment to President-elect Barack Obama and his family. They're in town already because the Obama girls, Sasha and Malia, start school here tomorrow. Now, a small crowd is gathered outside the hotel here to see if they might just catch a glimpse of the Obama family, including Virgie Jones(ph), who is visiting from Oklahoma. Why did you show up here this afternoon? </p>
    <p>Ms. VIRGIE JONES: To see if we could get a wave or some type of acknowledgement, but that's wishful thinking. But it's a beautiful day and just to get them started. It's part of history. Very proud.  </p>
    <p>RAZ: Well, thank you so much. Thank you, Virgie, so much. </p>
    <p>Ms. JOHN: Thank you. </p>
    <p>RAZ: Now, around the hotel, the streets are closed. The traffic is being redirected. But that's just a prelude to what happens here in town in two weeks and two days when up to three million people are expected to descend on        Washington for the inauguration. Now, if you're coming and if you have an interesting story to tell about your journey, we want to hear from you. Go to our Web site. That's npr.org/dctrip. </p>
