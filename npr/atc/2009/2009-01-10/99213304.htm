<h1> "Share Your Plans For The Inauguration" </h1>
    <p>REBECCA ROBERTS, host: </p>
    <p>I'm here on the west side of the Capitol, right near where they're building the stage for Barack Obama to take his oath of office in a little more than a week. The view from here is down the National Mall to the Washington Monument, a mile-long stretch that will be packed with people coming here to see history. Then there's another stretch between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial that will also be packed with people. If you plan to join all those crowds, we want to hear from you. Go to our Web site, npr.org/dctrip.  </p>
    <p>Tell us about how you're getting here, who you are traveling with, and any important stops you plan to make along the way. And then when you're actually on the road, give us an update. If you're Twittering or posting your photos on Flickr or videos on YouTube, tag your posts so we and our listeners can get a look. The tag to use is dctrip09. That's dstrip09, no spaces. And in the next week, NPR will introduce even more cool tools you can use to document your journey. You could find it all at npr.org/dctrip. </p>
