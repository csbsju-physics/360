    <p>If you or your kids are fans of "Dora the Explorer," "MTV," or "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart," you can breathe a sigh of relief today. Yesterday, we reported that the media giant Viacom was threatening to yank its many channels off Time Warner Cable at midnight. The two companies were in a bitter dispute over the amount of money Viacom wants for allowing Time Warner to carry its cable channels. Well, now we can tell you that they appeared to have reached a New Year's resolution. Viacom and Time Warner are still working at the terms of the deal, but "Comedy Central," "MTV" and, yes, "Dora the Explorer" will not be disappearing from your TV set. </p>
