<h1> "Fifth Grade Reporter To Cover Inauguration" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>We last spoke with 10-year-old Damon Weaver, a student journalist from Pahokee, Florida, last month when he was pushing to interview President-elect Barack Obama. Now he's here in Washington, D.C., for the inauguration. He had hoped to be credentialed as a journalist at the U.S. Capitol. Damon Weaver, thanks for coming in. </p>
    <p>Mr. DAMON WEAVER (Fifth Grade Student Journalist, Canal Point Elementary School, Florida): You're welcome. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: And did you get your credential? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Yes. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Where are you going to be? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Yesterday, I went to the opening ceremony and today, I will be going to the kid's concert. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: And what about tomorrow on Inauguration Day? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: I - we're going to the inauguration. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: And where will you be standing? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: I'm going to be closer where he doesn't look like a dot. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: He won't look like a dot.  </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter)  </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Yeah, you're going to be closer than a whole lot of people, I know that. Well, you went to a ball last night, is that right? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Yes. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Which one? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: The Root Ball. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: The Root Ball. </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Yes. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: And what did you see? What did you do? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: I saw a lot of people. I interviewed Oprah, Chris Tucker, T.D. Jakes, Samuel L. Jackson, Spike Lee, and some more people. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: That's a pretty busy night right there. </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Yes, and I was tired. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter)  </p>
    <p>BLOCK: You were? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: I went to sleep on the carpet. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: On the carpet at the ball? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Yes, the red carpet at there. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Well, what did you ask Oprah? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: What is it like being on a talk show? Can I get some advice for the students at my school? And then she took my mic, then interviewed me. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Oh, she did? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Yes. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: And what did she ask you? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: How do I feel about Barack Obama being president? What am I doing in a week of Washington, D.C.? And that's about all I know of. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Well, you have this interview request, this longstanding interview request, with Barack Obama. Any progress on that? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Nah. There is no yes, and there is no no. So, we don't know if we're going to get an interview or not. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Now if, by some chance, Barack Obama happens to be listening to this program right now, do you have a message for him, anything you'd like to tell him? </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: Hi, Barack Obama. I'm Damon Weaver. I already interviewed your vice president, Joe Biden, and I also called him my home boy. So if you want to be my home boy, too, please let me interview you - and that rhymes.  </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Damon Weaver, thanks so much for coming in. </p>
    <p>Mr. WEAVER: You're welcome. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: Damon Weaver is a fifth grader and a reporter for his school's TV station at Canal Point Elementary School in Florida. He's here in Washington for the inauguration, and still hoping to score an interview with the president-elect. </p>
