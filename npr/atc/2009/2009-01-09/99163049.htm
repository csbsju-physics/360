<h1> "Inauguration Day: Hooray, Hooray!" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>In less than two weeks, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the next president of the United States. All Things Considered has commissioned some of the country's finest poets to commemorate the moment in verse. Starting us off today is Calvin Trillin. </p>
    <p>Mr. CALVIN TRILLIN (Author; "Deciding the Next Decider: The 2008 Presidential Race in Rhyme"): (Reciting) Inauguration is the day The nation's hopes go on display -When through one man we all convey Our dream that things will go our way. His resume we can't gainsay. In politics, it's clear, his play Is worthy of the NBA. He proved that in the recent fray, Though he had help from Tina Fey. And now this solemn matinee Awards his country's top bouquet. First, Pastor Warren's going to pray For everyone who isn't gay. Obama then will stand and say, I take this oath that I'll obey The statutes of the U.S.A. In his address, he might portray The dragons he intends to slay: How Wall Street's sky will turn from grey To blue as blues are chased away; How workers will collect good pay For turning out a Chevrolet; How in Iraq we'll end our stay With shortest possible delay; How pay-to-play will be passe So, K Street suits will not hold sway. Yes, how we'll triumph, come what may, And rise up like a good souffle 'Til life's just like a cabaret. Obamacons will shout hooray And toast their man with chardonnay As commentators all make hay, Comparing him to JFK. The Beltway types, those still blase, Might think that soon, with some dismay, We'll wonder if his feet are clay. But that's all for another day. </p>
