<h1> "Letters: Correction, Hockey Stick" </h1>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, host: </p>
    <p>Now it's time for your letters. </p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, host: </p>
    <p>First a correction. On yesterday's program, we brought you a story about the day's confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill. Some of you may have heard us say that Stephen Chu, who is President-elect Obama's nominee for energy secretary, won the Nobel Prize for his work on renewable energy and climate change. </p>
    <p>NORRIS: Well, as Roland Dunbrac(ph) of Philadelphia correctly pointed out, Mr. Chu actually won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1997 for his work on, as the prize officially stated, the development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light.  </p>
    <p>Yesterday we also brought you the story of the boy, the dentist, and the hockey stick. The boy is 14-year-old Kalan Plew. After the recent Winter Classic at Wrigley Field, a Detroit Red Wings player gave him his hockey stick. Kalan Plew was then stopped by a mysterious man who claimed to be a security guard who then took Kalan's stick and ran. And this is where we got the dentist, Robert Pappert of Charlotte, North Carolina. He bought the stick form the mysterious man in the bathroom at Wrigley Field. But when he learned of what happened to Kalan Plew, he mailed the hockey stick back to its rightful owner. </p>
    <p>BLOCK: John Mazer(ph) of Detroit writes that he was reminded of his own hockey stick story. He writes, in 1959, following a game at Detroit's old Olympia Stadium between the Red Wings and the Montreal Canadians, Jacques Plante, Montreal's Hall of Fame goaltender, gave me the stick he had won the game with. I was a 15-year-old aspiring goalie, and it became my greatest treasure. I hung it on my bedroom wall in a place of honor.  </p>
    <p>Three years later, when I left home for my freshman year at the University of Michigan, the stick stayed home. Unbeknownst to me, one day my little brother took the stick down to show it off to his friends and play street hockey. Somehow, they smashed it. It's now 50 years later, and I've never let him forget his misdeed. Note to Kalan, beware of little brothers. </p>
