    <p>It's a perfect storm of symbolism - the inauguration of the first African-American president who happens to be from Illinois, just like Abraham Lincoln, the president who ended slavery, Lincoln's Memorial, site of the famous "I Have A Dream" speech by Martin Luther King, whose birthday the nation celebrates tomorrow. All those themes converged at the Lincoln Memorial this afternoon along with hundreds of thousands of people. </p>
