<h1> "Inauguration Journey: No Longer Separate" </h1>
    <p>REBECCA ROBERTS, host: </p>
    <p>Sue Koehler is making an inaugural journey from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She's traveling a relatively short distance, but her story represents how far we've really come. In 1958, Sue was a sophomore at an all-white high school in North Carolina. And she remembers the day Brown versus Board of Education was decided. </p>
    <p>Ms. SUE KOEHLER: My mother, who was a very traditional southern lady, born in 1905, she said, well, you know, this is right.  This is the right thing.  And I went off to school and there was just furor.  All these kids were saying, my parents were saying I'll never have to go to school with a - and then the "N" word came out.  And I'll just never forget it.   </p>
    <p>I'm really lucky that I had parents who inspired me to understand that this separate society that I lived in was not quite right.  I don't think there are a lot of things in this country that have gotten better in 50 years, but that's one thing that has. And that's just the thing I want to celebrate. </p>
    <p>ROBERTS:  She'll be celebrating with a long-distance guest. Her sister-in-law is flying in from Germany for the festivities. </p>
