<h1> "Yes We Can, Yes We Can, Yes We Can!" </h1>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>We have one more political note, a poetic one. Only three poems have been read at presidential inaugurations, and they've been serious and sweeping. Well, Nikki Giovanni has a different style. She's one of the poets we've commissioned to write unofficial inaugural poems. Giovanni is an award-winning poet and spoken-word artist, and she has written an inaugural rap. She says it's for President-elect Obama to deliver himself. But until that day, here's Nikki Giovanni.</p>
    <p>NIKKI GIOVANNI: (Reciting) I'm Barack Obama And I'm here to say: I'm President Of the USA.</p>
    <p>I'll walk the streets And knock on doors Share with the folks: Not my dreams but yours.</p>
    <p>I'll talk with the people. I'll listen and learn. I'll make the butter, Then clean the churn.</p>
    <p>My wife is pretty. My children are sweet. We need one puppy To be complete.</p>
    <p>I represented in Springfield, Senated in D.C., Articulating all the while What change means to me.</p>
    <p>Some folk said "wait." Some said "not now." But here I am quite ready To take that president vow.</p>
    <p>The time is now For us to stand Because we all know Yes We Can, Yes We Can, Yes We Can.</p>
    <p>BLOCK: That's Nikki Giovanni. Her most recent collection of poetry is called "Bicycles: Love Poems." She's a professor of English at Virginia Tech.</p>
