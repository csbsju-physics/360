<h1> "Obama Chuckles At D.C. 'Snow Day'" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, host: </p>
    <p>More now on that much remarked on wintry weather in the capital today. The ice and freezing rain in Washington, D.C. closed 447 schools in the area. And this puzzled our new president who has just moved his family in from the Windy City. </p>
    <p>President BARACK OBAMA: My children's school was canceled today because of - what? </p>
    <p>Unidentified Woman: Ice. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>President OBAMA: Some ice?  </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>Unidentified Man: ...as Chicago. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>President OBAMA: As my children pointed out, in Chicago, school is never canceled. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>President OBAMA: In fact, my seven year old pointed out that you'd go outside for recess on a day like this. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>President OBAMA: You wouldn't even stay indoors. So, it's - I don't know, we're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness to this town. </p>
    <p>(Soundbite of laughter) </p>
    <p>President OBAMA: I'm saying when it comes to the weather, folks in Washington don't seem to be able to handle things. </p>
    <p>MICHELE NORRIS, host: </p>
    <p>Well, welcome to Washington, Mr. President. Though we note that the District of Columbia public schools were open today, though, they started two hours late. </p>
