<h1> "Some In Inaugural Audience Weigh In" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL: Some of Barack Obama's Kenyan relatives traveled to Washington to witness his swearing in and we've been hearing today from many people who traveled some distance who overcame a few hurdles to attend this Inauguration.</p>
    <p>JUDIDAH ISLER: My name is Judidah Isler, I'm a graduate student at Yale University. I traveled down by bus today. We have just seen so many people of so many different persuasions and backgrounds and hues just come together, just even standing there singing all the songs together before Inauguration was amazing.</p>
    <p>IKE SMITH: Ike Smith. Right here, Washington, D.C. area, Northern Virginia down about Mount Vernon. We were planning to catch the shuttle, got to the Pentagon, they said, No, you can't get there. Somebody told them that they can't bring the buses across the bridge. And then we went to catch the Blue Line. It was all crowded. I mean, jam packed. So, we decided to walk.</p>
    <p>MINERVA FRANCIS: I'm Minerva Francis, Brooklyn, New York. So we were walking from Crystal City across the bridge. It's been exiting. The train somehow broke down and fortunately we get to walk and burn some calories, toward the change, yeah, a healthier America.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Voices from Washington today.</p>
