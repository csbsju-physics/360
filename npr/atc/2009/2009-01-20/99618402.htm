<h1> "Kennedy Reportedly Talking After Taking Ill" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: </p>
    <p>Well, we have one more note on the day in Washington. Two of the country's elder statesmen suddenly left the Inaugural luncheon this afternoon. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts became ill. Kennedy has been battling brain cancer, and he reportedly suffered a seizure. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and he's reportedly awake and speaking now. Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia also left the luncheon. Byrd is 91. His staff later said that he is in fine health and that Senator Byrd left out of concern for his colleague.</p>
