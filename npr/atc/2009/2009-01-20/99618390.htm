    <p>From NPR News, this is All Things Considered. I'm Robert Siegel.</p>
    <p>MELISSA BLOCK, Host: </p>
    <p>And I'm Melissa Block. Today, President Barack Obama declared a new era of responsibility. We're going to listen now to his inaugural speech in its entirety.</p>
    <p>SIEGEL: Mr. Obama spoke in front of a shimmering sea of people waving American flags as far as the eye could see. Here is President Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>OBAMA: America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.</p>
