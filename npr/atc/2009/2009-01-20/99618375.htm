    <p>Our staff canvassed the National Mall today, and we found people in the crowd of varying political backgrounds. They were all cold, but jubilant.</p>
    <p>LEROY WRIGHT: My name is Leroy Wright. I'm from South Carolina. And it's a great day because I believe in this country. If we all come together, we can become as one people, as God wants us to be.</p>
    <p>DARRYL WALTER: My name is Darryl Walter from St. Louis, Missouri. My great grandfather died at a hundred, and I have a living grandmother who's 93, who voted - and they never thought that they would see it. And for them, I came today.</p>
    <p>BRITNEY WESSON: I'm Britney Wesson from Colorado, but I go to school here in D.C. The speech was wonderful. I mean, I was a Hillary person. Hopefully, it will be my time next time, but for now, I think it was really awesome.</p>
    <p>DAVID PALL: My name is David Pall. I live here in Washington, D.C. I'm a Republican, and I have to say that speech was beautiful. It's awesome to be among this many people.</p>
