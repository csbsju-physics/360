<h1> "Composer Sets Politics To Music In Scoring Campaign Ads" </h1>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>The millions of dollars presidential candidates spend on ads support an industry that doesn't get a whole lot of attention outside of campaign season. As part of our series Snapshots 2016, NPR's Tamara Keith introduces us to a man who helps give those ads their epic sound.</p>
    <p>TODD HAHN: My name is Todd Hahn. I'm a composer.</p>
    <p>TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Todd Hahn has been composing music for campaign ads for 25 years. But it's not what he imagined for himself when he was a budding musician growing up in the '70s. He wanted to write music for television and movies.</p>

    <p>HAHN: Seeing those big, epic movies as a young person, like, you know, "Star Wars" or "The Magnificent Seven" - any of these big, epic movies and Westerns that had just these gorgeous scores. You'd say, I want to do that.</p>
    <p>KEITH: Hahn studied composition at Juilliard but never finished. For a while, he was scoring documentaries for the Discovery Channel and National Geographic. And then a producer of campaign ads asked if he could score an ad for a down-ballot race in Pennsylvania. He did, and the rest is more or less history.</p>
    <p>HAHN: One thing leads to the other, and if, you know, you're a composer or any sort of creative person and you have steady work, you know, and it's good work, you sort of stay with it.</p>
    <p>KEITH: At the peak of the campaign season, Hanh says he'll score as many as 18 ads a day. Over the course of his career, he figures he's done 12,000 or 15,000.</p>
    <p>HAHN: And most of them are, you know, during the election cycle, negative ads.</p>
    <p>KEITH: He's a master at composing music that gives ads an emotional punch. For negative ads, Hahn says an ethereal sound works well.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>HAHN: They work really nice for negative ads or - like a candidate could just be speaking, like, at 3 o'clock in the morning on, you know, September 4.</p>
    <p>KEITH: But he gets to do positive ads, too, the kind of sweeping bio ads that introduce people to a candidate or reintroduce them.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>HAHN: Music needs to be a metaphor for what you're seeing and what you're hearing, you know? I mean, that works the analytical side of your brain. But then when you hear the music, you know, with the visuals, it - something inside you is tweaked.</p>
    <p>KEITH: And the best ads, the most cinematic, get Hahn close to that thing he dreamed of when he was a kid.</p>
    <p>HAHN: To me, they are like little film scores. In my humble way, I try to make that like a little film score. Those are the fun kind of jobs.</p>
    <p>KEITH: Hahn works for both parties, which leads to some interesting contrasts. In 2004, he scored a Democratic Party ad for presidential candidate John Kerry.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>JOHN KERRY: I defended this country as a young man, and I will defend...</p>
    <p>KEITH: A couple of weeks later...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I served with John Kerry.</p>
    <p>KEITH: ...He wrote the music for the now-infamous Swift Boat ad that helped sink Kerry's candidacy.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
    <p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: He is lying about his record.</p>
    <p>KEITH: It might be surprising, but Todd Hahn says he's not a political person. He failed his high school government class. Hahn really sees himself working for the producers of the ads, not the candidates themselves.</p>
    <p>HAHN: The candidates - to me, I've done it for so long that they're political candidates. They come and go (laughter), and God bless them.</p>
    <p>KEITH: Because they pay the bills. Tamara Keith, NPR News.</p>
