<h1> "On Wikipedia's 15th Anniversary, A Look At The Most-Edited Entries" </h1>
    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p>
    <p>OK, Kelly, guess what these people have in common. Ready? Adolf Hitler, Britney Spears, George W. Bush, Jesus and Michael Jackson.</p>
    <p>KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: </p>
    <p>I have no idea.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Their entries are among the most edited pages on Wikipedia.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Wikipedia, which, of course, turns 15 years old today.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Happy birthday, Wikipedia.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: As we know the entries can be edited by anyone. And this week, the website FiveThirtyEight dug up the most edited pages for each year of Wikipedia's existence.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: The first one is obvious and not really fair - the page that lists deaths in any given year is constantly being updated.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Yeah, exactly.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: But put that aside and FiveThirtyEight quantitative editor Andrew Flowers says things get really interesting.</p>
    <p>ANDREW FLOWERS: Wikipedia - maybe this is a testament to its broad appeal - really covers all its bases here. So, for example, in 2012, you have the Syrian Civil War right up there with "Gangnam Style" as the two most edited Wikipedia pages.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: I believe it's "Gangnam Style."</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GANGNAM STYLE")</p>
    <p>PSY: (Singing in Korean).</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: That's right - the Korean pop song.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Right. So it wasn't always this way. In Wikipedia's first year, the entry on creationism was number one with 124 edits. Then it gained steam and...</p>
    <p>FLOWERS: There's over 20,000 edits for George W. Bush in 2005.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: George W. Bush is still the most edited Wikipedia entry of all time - 46,000 edits, Ari.</p>
    <p>SHAPIRO: Some people get really into editing some obscure Wikipedia pages, and that shows in these numbers. Take last year - after the death page, the most edited one was not about Donald Trump or Star Wars. Here it is - geospatial summary of the high peaks/summits of the Juneau Icefield.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Of course.</p>
    <p>FLOWERS: Which - I don't know about you - I'm not following the geospatial summaries of Alaskan peaks that closely, but a dedicated person and observer who's logging hundreds of edits a day which we found in the early months of 2015 ranked up over 7,000 edits.</p>
    <p>MCEVERS: Wow. That's FiveThirtyEight's Andrew Flowers. For more Wikipedia, listen to Weekend Edition tomorrow when we talk to Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TOXIC")</p>
    <p>BRITNEY SPEARS: Baby, can't you see? I'm calling. A guy like you should wear a warning.</p>
