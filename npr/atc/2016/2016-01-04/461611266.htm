<h1> "Natalia Lafourcade Explains The Roots Of 'Hasta La Ra\u00edz' " </h1>
    <p>AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: </p>
    <p>Now we're going to hear the story behind a popular song.</p>
    <p>NATALIA LAFOURCADE: My name is Natalia Lafourcade. I'm a singer, songwriter from Mexico.</p>
    <p>CORNISH: Natalia Lafourcade won four Latin Grammys back in November, including for this song, "Hasta La Raiz." It means to the roots.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HASTA LA RAIZ")</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: (Singing in Spanish).</p>
    <p>CORNISH: She explained how her hit song was made on Song Exploder, a podcast that unpacks songs with the musicians who created them. Natalia Lafourcade says this song started with a conversation.</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: I went to my friend's house. His name is Leonel Garcia, and he's a great composer from Mexico as well. I know him since long ago. We were talking about the importance of keeping your roots and keeping all the things that build you - your home, your friends, your family, your experiences. I wanted to sing about something that will remind me of Mexico and home. So I was telling him, like, why don't we try a very traditional riff from Mexico - this huapango thing on the guitar? So he started, like, playing that huapango.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: There is huapangos in many areas in Mexico, but I never tried to put any music like that into my music and mix it with this pop sensation of a song.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: I started, like, trying to put the words together and to make the phrases of the song. So I went into the studio, and I started discovering the words by singing them.</p>
    <p>(Singing in Spanish).</p>
    <p>So I was getting these goosebumps and all that magic feelings that comes to you whenever you're singing a song that you're just discovering.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: So I called my friend Mariana Ruiz. So she came to my house, and we worked on the arrangements.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: I think that the strings give you the feeling of an epic feeling. And that's how you feel when you're flying away from something and you're - you are going through so many things that make you stronger. I wanted to have that emotion and that sensation in the arrangement.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: We were first doing that melody - pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa (ph) - with a xylophone and with the steel drum. Then he put that melody into the guitar.</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: There is this line...</p>
    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HASTA LA RAIZ")</p>
    <p>LAFOURCADE: (Singing in Spanish).</p>
    <p>(Speaking Spanish). You are still inside of me because I am keeping you. I am not forgetting. I keep you inside of me. I mean many different things. It is love, but it is also all the things that built me and that help me to be who I am now. So I keep all that. I keep my home. I keep the place I come from. I keep my mother, my father. I keep my lovers. I keep my experiences. The good and the bad moments - I keep all that. It is important not to forget your roots. Keep that, and you can grow up. And you can fly far away, and you can be a big artist or whatever you want to be. But it is important, I think, to keep all that.</p>
