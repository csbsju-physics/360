<h1> "Gun-Toting Women Give Rise To Firearms Fashion Accessories" </h1>
    <p>ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: </p>
    <p>We've heard a lot about the recent increase in gun sales. Federal data showed a new high was set in December. We hear less, though, about the gun accessory business, especially for women - concealed-carry purses, bra holsters, concealment leggings. That industry is booming, too. Just look at Texas. The state's open carry law took effect on January 1, but many are choosing to keep their guns out of sight. Lauren Silverman of member station KERA sent this report from Dallas.</p>
    <p>LAUREN SILVERMAN, BYLINE: Ray's Sporting Goods in Oak Cliff is a neighborhood firearm dreamland. It's stocked with the latest pistols, shotguns and AR-15 military-style rifles. On today's lunch break, men in suits, shorts, leather boots and sandals are all waiting in line, pushed up against the glass display cases like cats pawing at a fish tank. Recently, the store manager, Chuck Payne, says he's sold to a lot more ladies.</p>
    <p>CHUCK PAYNE: A lot of married ladies with their husbands, some without. But they've decided that - husband's not home, they need to be able to do something. And they need a different gun than what the husband has.</p>
    <p>SILVERMAN: And with that different gun, they often want different accessories. At Ray's there are purses with hidden pockets, bright pink toolkits with tiny screws for gun maintenance and fruit-punch-colored magazine loaders.</p>
    <p>PAYNE: And this is for loading the magazine so they don't break off their fingernails and make their fingers sore.</p>
    <p>SILVERMAN: There's no accurate count of women gun owners, but in a 2015 report from the National Sporting Goods Association, 5.4 million women said they went target shooting. That's up 60 percent from 2001. Here's the thing - since January 1, store manager Payne hasn't seen one woman come in carrying openly. There are a couple of reasons for that. A lot of women simply don't want to draw attention to themselves. Then there's the logistics of actually wearing a gun.</p>
    <p>CARRIE LIGHTFOOT: Most concealed and open-carry holsters are made for men.</p>
    <p>SILVERMAN: Carrie Lightfoot is CEO of The Well-Armed Woman. It's an online store based in Arizona. She says a woman's body shape and size are important considerations when it comes to open or concealed carry.</p>
    <p>LIGHTFOOT: So for example, a 32A bust could not conceal a Glock 19 very well, nor would a 42DD or a larger tummy allow for effective cross draw carry.</p>
    <p>SILVERMAN: Lightfoot sells bra holsters, concealment leggings, lace waistbands and leopard-print gun holders for cars. She says sales are up 130 percent since the summer. Still, the vast majority of women don't open carry, and that means one of the hottest accessories is the concealed-carry purse, which is Kate Woolstenhulme's business.</p>
    <p>KATE WOOLSTENHULME: And they all come packed like this, you know, from the manufacturer.</p>
    <p>SILVERMAN: In her Plano home office, Woolstenhulme unpacks one of her newest designs. It's a black leather purse with a herringbone embossed pattern. She introduced her first line of concealed-carry bags in 2009, after failing to track down a handbag that was both safe and fashionable for her 9 mm Baretta Nano handgun.</p>
    <p>WOOLSTENHULME: I was interested in making something that really functioned, and yet still making sure that it looked as if that woman had walked into Nordstrom's or Neiman's or Marshalls or whatever they shop at.</p>
    <p>SILVERMAN: The ostrich and crocodile skin handbags sell for thousands of dollars. Others are a few hundred. They all have locking devices.</p>
    <p>WOOLSTENHULME: The holster pocket is on the exterior of the bag.</p>
    <p>SILVERMAN: A recent study showed women who bought a gun in the last year spent, on average, $870 on firearms and more than $400 on accessories. Both Woolstenhulme and Carrie Lightfoot warn women to choose new holsters and bags wisely. Just because it's made in pink doesn't guarantee it was designed for a woman's body.
